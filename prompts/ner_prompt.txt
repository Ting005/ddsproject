---  

### Instructions:  

#### 1. Entity Standardization  

**Individuals:**  
- Resolve ambiguities using contextual clues (e.g., "John Smith (CTO of StartupX)" vs. "John Smith (Senator)").  
- Standardize names to a **canonical form** (e.g., "Dr. Smith" → "John Smith").  
- Maintain a **mentions array** for all detected name variations.  

**Organizations:**  
- Normalize aliases to official names (e.g., "MSFT" → "Microsoft").  
- Identify **parent-subsidiary relationships** where applicable.  

**Amounts & Transactions:**  
- Extract all **monetary expressions** (e.g., "$2.4M", "114 million Rupees") and link them to **relevant entities/events**.  

---  

#### 2. Relationship Extraction  

Extract **explicit and implicit relationships** in **triplet format**:  
⟨Subject, Predicate, Object⟩  

**Relationship Categories:**  

- **Person-Person:** Accomplice Of, Associate Of, Relative Of, Alias Of, Legal Representative Of  
- **Person-Organization:** Founder Of, CEO Of, Board Member Of, Shareholder Of, Employee Of, Beneficiary Of  
- **Organization-Organization:** Subsidiary Of, Partner Of, Supplier Of, Client Of, Sanctioned By  
- **Entity-Crime:** Accused Of, Convicted Of, Investigated For, Linked To, Witness To

- **Others:** Affiliation (Person-Organization), Financial/Transaction (Company-Company), Regulatory/Legal (Agency-Entity), Geopolitical (Country-Organization)  

---  

#### 3. Summarization Guidelines  

- **Prioritize entities** with multiple relationship ties.  
- **Emphasize direct contextual evidence** (e.g., quotes, official statements).  
- Maintain a **neutral, third-person tone**.
