But Tjioe has now been sentenced to 30 months’ jail, after the High Court also allowed the prosecution’s appeal against his acquittal.Their current ages were not stated in the High Court judgment.Sim was the founder and chief executive of Jason Parquet Specialist (JPS) at the time of the offences between 2012 and 2015.JPS was a wholly owned subsidiary of public-listed company Jason Parquet Holdings. JPS was liquidated in 2016, while the parent company changed its name to Revez Corp in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch up on the news that everyone’s talking about\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTati Trading was one of JPS’ biggest suppliers. JPS had invoice financing facilities with three banks, which allowed the parquet company to obtain loans to pay its suppliers after the purchase and delivery of goods. When JPS applied to draw down on the financing facilities, it has to provide an invoice and delivery order from its suppliers to the banks as supporting documents. After the application is approved, the banks disburse money directly to the suppliers.Between September 2012 and March 2015, JPS submitted five applications for invoice financing from the banks. Each application was authorised by Sim.At the time each application was made, no goods as described in the supporting documents had been physically delivered to JPS. Sim was charged with five counts of cheating for deceiving the banks with false invoices and delivery orders to dishonestly induce the banks to disburse $2 million in total to Tati.He was also charged over indirectly providing financial assistance to Tjioe in connection with the proposed acquisition of shares in Jason Parquet Holdings. More on this Topic3 years’ jail for parquet firm  founder who duped 3 banks into disbursing over $2m in loansMore than 3 years’ jail for man linked to loan ruse in which banks were cheated of over $1mTjioe faced five charges for intentionally aiding Sim to cheat the banks, by instructing his employee to prepare and submit the invoices and delivery orders to JPS. The case was referred to the police after internal auditors of Jason Parquet Holdings highlighted potential overstatement in its profits and losses, and an external audit was conducted.After a trial in a district court, Sim was convicted of the five cheating charges but acquitted of the sixth charge, while Tjioe was acquitted of all his five charges.In July 2023, Sim was sentenced to a three-year jail term. He appealed to the High Court against his conviction and sentence.The prosecution appealed for a longer sentence, and also appealed against the acquittals.The appeal was heard in March 2024.In July 2024, High Court judge Vincent Hoong allowed the prosecution’s appeal. Justice Hoong overturned the acquittals and increased Sim’s sentence on the cheating charges. He then adjourned the case for written submissions to be filed on the sentences to be imposed on Tjioe and for Sim’s sixth charge.On Feb 19, he imposed a one-year jail term for Sim’s sixth charge, to run concurrently with the 44-month jail term that was handed down earlier.More on this TopicJail for 5 men linked to housing loan scam; bank duped into disbursing over $5.1m Jail for mastermind of scheme that duped 3 banks into disbursing over $13mIn upholding Sim’s conviction, Justice Hoong found that the invoices and delivery orders submitted to the banks were fictitious, and that Sim had the dishonest intention to cheat the banks. He said Sim’s sentence for his cheating charges was raised as a deterrent sentence, which was warranted to prevent such offences from pervading Singapore’s financial ecosystem, which may lead to banks imposing stricter rules of compliance or withdrawing their trade financing services entirely. He also considered that Sim had carefully orchestrated the fraud for his personal benefit. As for Sim’s sixth charge, Justice Hoong found that the illegal payment to Tjioe was used to fund the subscription of shares of Jason Parquet Holdings.As for Tjioe, Justice Hoong said in his judgment that he was less culpable than Sim in respect of the cheating charges.Nonetheless, there was a considerable degree of planning and premeditation on the part of Tjioe, and Tjioe was aware of all key aspects of the fraudulent scheme, he said.In convicting Tjioe on his abetment charges, the judge rejected Tjioe’s defence that he was unaware that the fictitious invoices and delivery orders would be used for an improper purpose. The fictitious documents were prepared on Tjioe’s instructions, with full knowledge that they would be used by Sim to obtain fraudulent loans, said the judge.In September 2012, DBS paid out $535,000 to Tati after approving JPS’ application for financing.More on this TopicEx-CFO jailed 20 years after duping financial institutions, causing losses of more than $631mMan allegedly duped Chubb Insurance Singapore into paying out over $8.9 million in false claimsTati then issued a cheque for $535,000 to Tjioe. On the same day, Tjioe deposited the cheque into his personal bank account and paid $568,523.75 to subscribe for 2.5 million shares in Jason Parquet Holdings during its initial public offering (IPO). The police on Feb 19 said that Sim faces 11 more charges for allegedly perpetrating similar invoice financing fraud with three other suppliers to cheat five banks into disbursing a total of over $2.5 million. He is also charged over allegedly providing illegal financial assistance to one of the three suppliers to subscribe for shares in Jason Parquet Holdings’ IPO. The suppliers concerned are alleged to have intentionally aided Sim in the invoice financing fraud; and they face between one and nine charges each, said the police.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo››UPDATED Jan 24, 2025, 08:42 PMThanks for sharing!Mastercard and Visa failed to stop their payment networks from laundering proceeds from child sexual abuse material and sex trafficking on the popular website OnlyFans, according to allegations in a previously undisclosed whistleblower complaint filed with the U.S. Treasury’s financial crimes unit.The whistleblower, a senior compliance expert in the credit card and banking industries, said the two giant card companies knew their networks were being used to pay for illegal content on the porn-driven site since at least 2021, and accused them of “turning a blind eye to flows of illicit revenue.”The complaint was filed in January 2023 with the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the U.S. Justice and Homeland Security departments, the whistleblower said. The complaint said that the whistleblower and other anti-trafficking experts, including U.S. federal agents, alerted Visa and Mastercard to unlawful content on OnlyFans in a series of calls in 2021 and 2022. The federal agents corroborated the presence of child sexual abuse material on OnlyFans, the complaint said. It also drew heavily on a 2022 study by an anti-trafficking group that said it had found a “high volume” of OnlyFans accounts with “common indicators” of child sexual abuse material or sex trafficking. The whistleblower said he helped with the study, which was shared with the card companies. On OnlyFans, Visa and Mastercard process payments between content creators and their customers. When the content is child sexual abuse material, the card companies are “directly handling the proceeds of these illicit transactions,” said the complaint. By continuing to process payments on OnlyFans, Mastercard and Visa had “willfully failed” to maintain effective anti-money laundering programs required by the Bank Secrecy Act, said the complaint, which urged FinCEN and the two other federal agencies to take action against the card companies. Reuters reviewed an email confirming FinCEN had received the complaint. In response to questions, the agency said it doesn’t confirm or deny the existence of whistleblower complaints. The Justice and Homeland Security departments declined to comment. Reuters could not determine what action, if any, the agencies took in response to the complaint, which was filed under FinCEN's anti-money laundering whistleblower program launched in 2021. Under that program, complaints are confidential and the identity of whistleblowers is protected. However, Reuters reviewed the complaint, interviewed the whistleblower on condition of anonymity, and corroborated his identity and credentials. The complaint said he had extensive expertise in fighting money laundering.In an interview, the whistleblower said the agencies never contacted him to discuss his complaint. The card companies had “the power to turn off the switch” to stop illicit material from being monetized, he added. Mastercard and Visa said they hadn’t heard of the 2023 whistleblower complaint until Reuters contacted them. They disputed the complaint’s allegations and cited their efforts to keep their networks free of illegal activity. A Visa spokesperson said financial institutions and merchants that don't comply with Visa’s “robust compliance requirements” will be terminated from its network. The company uses “best-in-class controls to deter, detect and remediate illegal activity,” the spokesperson said. Mastercard holds all users of its payments system to high standards and, “if illegal activity is identified, we work with partners to act,” its spokesperson said. The three government agencies hadn’t “referred any specific illegal activity for us to investigate or act on,” the spokesperson added. “No evidence of current illegal activity has been provided to us,” despite the whistleblower’s claim, the spokesperson said.The spokesperson denied that Mastercard had “failed” to maintain effective anti-money laundering programs. The company has “strong governance standards through a comprehensive compliance program and strong internal controls,” he said.Since the whistleblower complaint was filed, Reuters uncovered more allegations of child sexual abuse and sex trafficking on OnlyFans, a porn-driven site that generates money through subscriptions and pay-per-view content. In July, the news organization reported that hundreds of sexually explicit videos and images of minors, some as young as toddlers, have appeared on the site since 2019, according to allegations in police complaints. In December, a child exploitation investigator told Reuters that he reported 26 OnlyFans accounts to authorities that appeared to contain sexual content featuring underage teen girls. The accounts were quickly taken down, said the investigator. Another story focused on women who said they had been sexually enslaved, sometimes by a fiancé or boyfriend, to make money on the platform. The Mastercard spokesperson called Reuters’ findings on child sexual abuse on OnlyFans “alarming” but said law enforcement or certain child-protection groups would need to provide evidence of illegal activity for the company to act or investigate. Visa didn’t comment on whether the company was investigating Reuters’ findings.UK-based OnlyFans didn’t respond to questions about the whistleblower complaint. On its website, the company says it enforces a “zero-tolerance policy” against any content related to child abuse or trafficking, and blocks or takes down material that violates its rules. It said it also reports illegal content to law enforcement and child-protection groups. In a previous statement, OnlyFans told Reuters it works to “aggressively target, report, and support the investigations and prosecutions” of anyone who abuses the platform.OnlyFans is one of the world’s fastest-growing and most lucrative creator platforms. It relies heavily on payment cards to process subscriptions, tips and other transactions between its more than 300 million users and its four million content creators. Its surging profits have made it a leader in the creator economy. In September, OnlyFans reported $6.6 billion in gross payments to creators, up 20% from the year before. It made $1.3 billion in revenue. ‘UNCOMFORTABLE IMAGES’Many porn websites are free and make money mostly from advertising. OnlyFans, by contrast, takes a 20% cut of the income its creators earn from selling content to subscribers, who must enter their card details to pay for it.OnlyFans accepts cards by Mastercard, Visa, Discover and some of their partners. In certain countries, it allows other options such as online payments provider Paysafe, which didn’t respond to a request for comment. American Express can’t be used on OnlyFans under a longstanding global policy that prohibits its cards from being used for online adult content, a spokesperson said. Payment services such as Apple Pay and Google Pay also have similar policies against online porn transactions.In the U.S., OnlyFans’ main market, Visa and Mastercard account for the vast majority of all card purchases, according to industry data. The complaint did not make any allegations against Discover, saying its small market share meant it was “unlikely to be one of the main payment methods used on OnlyFans.\" A spokesperson for Discover declined to comment.In 2020, Visa, Mastercard and Discover blocked customers from using their cards to make purchases on Pornhub, another big adults-only platform, after a public outcry over alleged child sexual abuse material and other illegal content. This stopped card payments for Pornhub’s paid content and forced it to rely more on ads and sales of user data.In May 2021, the BBC detailed several cases of explicit videos of underage teens on OnlyFans. Three months later, 102 members of Congress called for a Justice Department investigation into alleged child sexual abuse material on OnlyFans. The department declined to comment on the status of that request.In November 2021, senior executives at Mastercard held a tense call with a group of anti-trafficking experts, some of whom wanted the company to cut ties with OnlyFans, according to a person who attended. The site was hosting child sexual abuse material, the experts told the Mastercard executives. And one expert – a U.S. federal agent – said he could prove it. During the call, said the attendee, the agent accessed an OnlyFans account with sexually explicit images of what he said was a young girl. The agent described the images to others on the call but didn’t share them, which would have been illegal. Mastercard told Reuters that its team had one call with a group in which “explicit and uncomfortable images” were discussed but said it couldn’t confirm when the call took place. Afterward, the card company requested that all financial institutions connecting OnlyFans to its payment network confirm the site’s compliance with \"our standards and applicable law,” the Mastercard spokesperson said.“Each of them affirmed that status,” he said, without identifying the institutions.In April 2022, the Anti-Human Trafficking Intelligence Initiative (ATII), a U.S. nonprofit, published its study which the whistleblower complaint drew upon. ATII, whose work includes identifying illegal content online, reported that it had discovered numerous OnlyFans accounts with indicators of child sexual abuse material or sex trafficking. The indicators included keywords and images found by searching the publicly available profiles of OnlyFans creators, said the ATII report. With these methods, researchers uncovered a “tremendous amount of troubling material” on the platform, it said. The whistleblower said he reviewed the report, which notes the anti-money laundering duties of financial institutions, before publication to ensure it reflected industry practice.ATII’s investigation was shared with Mastercard and Visa, the whistleblower complaint said. The companies didn’t respond to questions about the ATII report. ATII declined to comment.‘BUSINESS AS USUAL’Both Mastercard and Visa have tightened their rules around porn sites in recent years. In October 2021, Mastercard introduced stricter rules aimed at \"preventing illegal adult content on our network.\" They were prompted by the ease with which people could now upload content to the internet, said John Verdeschi, a senior vice president, in a statement at the time.Under those rules, merchants of adult content – in this case, OnlyFans – were required to verify the identity and age of people featured and obtain written consent from everyone depicted. The rules also required porn sites to produce monthly reports that flag “potentially illegal” content and send those to banks that process Mastercard payments.In an interview in August that year with the Financial Times, OnlyFans founder and then-CEO Tim Stokely said his platform was “already fully compliant” with the Mastercard requirements. In 2023, Visa also introduced stricter rules for its “high integrity risk merchants.” This included adult-related businesses, dating services, gambling and pharmacies. Under the rules, banks were expected to more closely monitor merchants to prevent illegal transactions.The whistleblower complaint said the card companies appeared to be shifting the blame for processing payments related to child sexual abuse material onto banks “while carrying on with business as usual.” Visa and Mastercard did not comment on that assertion.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Jan 2 prohibited Mr Parekh and others from buying and selling securities, as well as associating with any entity registered with the regulator, an order published on Sebi’s website showed. The regulator investigated trades undertaken by individuals and brokers associated with Mr Parekh over a two-year period ending June 2023, the order said.Sebi’s investigation showed that Mr Parekh allegedly obtained non-public information of a major US fund’s trades from Singapore-based Mr Rohit Salgaocar, who had an agreement to refer trades of that fund to Motilal Oswal Financial Services and Nuvama Wealth Management. Mr Parekh then passed on the information to his associates to front run the trades, Sebi member Kamlesh Varshney said in the order.Mr Parekh was earlier banned by Sebi in 2003 for 14 years for insider trading, price rigging and illegal diversion of bank funds into the stock market. His actions triggered a crash in India’s stock market during February and March 2001. Sebi’s latest move against Mr Parekh comes amid a rise in front-running cases in the country just as its stock market is booming.Mr Varshney has also ordered the impounding of about 658 million rupees (S$10.5 million) in “unlawful gains” made by the entities allegedly involved in the scam. Mr Parekh and 21 others named in the Sebi order have been given 21 days to respond to the findings.

Alam Group have been frozen by the interim government and Bangladeshi state agencies in “an unlawful, arbitrary and discriminatory fashion”.“This has adversely affected the business operations of the S. Alam Group, which have almost come to a standstill,” the lawyers said.“It is likely that the businesses will have to cease operations within the next month or two, which also potentially means the loss of jobs for 200,000 employees.”All four members of the family were born in the country’s second-largest city, Chittagong.More on this TopicS’pore businessman investigated for over 150 potential offences in $72m embezzlement case    Executive in Australia allegedly stole $2.38m from Singapore’s CapitaLand Ascott TrustAccording to documents from investigative journalism group Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, they obtained Cypriot citizenship in 2016 via the Golden Visa programme, an investment-for-citizenship initiative. Mr Alam’s lawyers said the family settled down in Singapore in 2009 and became permanent residents here in 2011. They received Singapore citizenship in 2023. The Straits Times sent queries to Singapore’s Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) about the allegations, and also asked if it has received requests for legal assistance from the Bangladeshi authorities.Without commenting on the allegations, the ministry said foreign jurisdictions can make a formal request to Singapore for mutual legal assistance if there is credible evidence of links between  assets and  offences committed. “Under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (Macma), Singapore can provide mutual legal assistance to foreign jurisdictions, including through information sharing on the movement of assets and the enforcement of foreign confiscation orders,” said MHA.“Singapore authorities also work together with foreign authorities on issues of asset sharing and the return of assets on a case-by-case basis.”Multiple probesMr Alam’s lawyers said their client has not been formally notified of any investigations by any of the authorities in Singapore and Bangladesh. They added that there have been concerted attacks by the interim government and Bangladeshi state agencies since the ouster in August 2024 of the government of Ms Sheikh Hasina.Major business conglomerates in Bangladesh, including the S. Alam Group, have been targeted, added the lawyers.The couple’s youngest child – Asadul Alam Mahir, 22 – is being separately probed for alleged tax evasion.Ms Hasina was twice the prime minister of Bangladesh, serving in the post for more than 20 years, with her most recent tenure being from January 2009 to August 2024.  During that period, an average of US$16 billion (S$21.55 billion) may have been illegally siphoned out of the country annually, according to a White Paper commissioned by interim leader Muhammad Yunus which was released on Dec 1.

Mr Ahsanul Alam was in June 2023 elected chairman of the board of directors of Islami Bank Bangladesh, a position he previously held at Union Bank. His sister Maimuna Khanam’s husband, Mr Belal Ahmed, was appointed chairman of Social Islami Bank that same year, having previously been vice-chairman of Global Islami Bank, with his wife having occupied the same post. Mr Alam and Ms Parveen also held key posts at First Security Islami Bank.By September, Mr Alam and his family no longer had any control of the banks they were involved in after the central bank restructured the boards.In response to Mr Mansur’s comments, Mr Alam’s lawyers said: “It appears that the governor of the Bank of Bangladesh has made these baseless allegations in furtherance of the continuing targeted smear media campaign against Mr Alam and other prominent businessmen.”They also pointed out that in February 2024, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh discharged rulings by the High Court Division, which had ordered investigations by various Bangladeshi state agencies.However, the Appellate Division also ruled that the Anti-Corruption Commission, Criminal Investigation Department and Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit can take legal steps on the matter of their own volition.In August, the Anti-Corruption Commission resumed its probe into Mr Alam and his associates for alleged money laundering following the change of government. In the ensuing months, the commission summoned officials from various banks in relation to investigations into alleged embezzlement involving the S. Alam Group and its associates.On Dec 18, Mr Alam’s American lawyers from the California-headquartered Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan sent a letter to the Bangladeshi government, highlighting their client’s nationality.The lawyers said the actions taken by the Yunus administration have “destroyed, in whole or in part”, the Alam family’s investments and violated a trade agreement signed between Singapore and Bangladesh in 2004. But the allegations continued.On Dec 19, the Anti-Corruption Commission filed a case against Mr Ahsanul Alam and others for allegedly misappropriating 1,092 crore taka from Islami Bank Bangladesh, according to local media outlets. A court in Bangladesh also issued a travel ban on Mr Alam and members of his family, following a request from the Anti-Corruption Commission in October.The businessman’s lawyers in Singapore said in relation to the travel ban: “Mr Alam, his wife and two of his sons are Singapore citizens. They are not Bangladeshi citizens.”More on this TopicMalaysia calls up S'pore businessman Akbar Khan in Daim-linked probeIndia seizes assets of late mining tycoon’s estate after probe prompted by Panama, Pandora Papers leaksBought hotelsAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra) records show that Canali Logistics was set up by Mr Alam and Ms Parveen in 2009. Mr Alam’s lawyers said that was the year they settled in Singapore.In 2014, the company bought Hotel Grand Chancellor in Little India for $248 million. The hotel has undergone multiple name changes and is now known as Hilton Garden Inn Singapore Serangoon.According to a Business Times report two years later, the company, which changed its name to Wilkinson International in 2017, acquired all the retail space of Centrium Square, also in Little India, for $135 million. The director and secretary of Wilkinson International until 2018 was Shahedul Huq. The former director of Union Bank in Bangladesh was later charged in his native Bangladesh with accumulating illegal wealth but fled to the US, according to news reports. Huq, who was a Singapore permanent resident, also had appointments in several other companies previously linked to Mr Alam.On Huq, Mr Alam’s lawyers in Singapore said: “Mr Alam discovered that Mr Huq had mismanaged funds in a manner inconsistent with the company’s policies.“On Mr Alam’s request, Mr Huq resigned.”Entities linked to Mr Alam also bought Ibis Singapore Novena in 2019 for nearly $170 million and Holiday Inn Express Singapore Serangoon for an undisclosed sum a year earlier, according to BT.Mr Alam’s property investments extend beyond the Causeway to Malaysia, with the 2016 purchase of Renaissance Kuala Lumpur Hotel and Convention Centre for RM765 million (S$231.6 million) via a company formerly known as Canali Logistics Sdn Bhd, according to BT and The Edge. The same company was also listed online as the owner of Four Points by Sheraton Kuala Lumpur, City Centre in 2023.ST visited the listed residence of Mr Alam and Ms Parveen in the Novena area on several occasions. Previous Acra filings listed their address as a condominium, also in Novena.While the pair were not spotted, several luxury cars were seen entering and exiting the multi-storey house, including three Rolls-Royces and a Porsche. The businessman’s lawyers in Singapore did not respond to ST’s query on the family’s current whereabouts.They said: “Given the absence of the rule of law and due process in Bangladesh...

Twenty-eight of them will appeal their sentences, state media said on Thursday.During her first trial in April, Lan was found guilty of embezzling US$12.5 billion, but prosecutors said the total damages caused by the scam amounted to US$27 billion – equivalent to around six per cent of the country’s 2023 GDP.Lan owned just 5 per cent of shares in SCB on paper, but at her trial, the court concluded that she effectively controlled more than 90 per cent through family, friends and staff. In April, a former chief inspector of the State Bank was given life in prison for accepting a US$5 million bribe to overlook financial problems at SCB.

Mr Ng has been out of contact for several weeks and is believed to have left Singapore.He has been replaced as chief executive officer (CEO) by a former Hewlett-Packard (HP) executive, Mr Hengky Oeni.In a further announcement yesterday, another former HP man, Mr Lee Kim Bock, 58, has come on board in the newly created position of president. His duties cover company operations and the development and expansion of group business.And two officers linked with the previous management - chief operating officer Richard Basil Jacob and chief financial officer Gan Chin Chin - have resigned as directors.Mr Jacob will stay on as an executive but Ms Gan, who is helping with the police investigations, is on unrecorded leave.And the white knights who last month proposed plans to inject up to $100 million into Citiraya - former HP managing director Koh Boon Hwee, 54, and fund manager Low Check Kian, 45 - have joined the board as non-executive directors.Citiraya’s chairman and independent director, Dr Michael Lim, told The Straits Times yesterday that Mr Oeni and Mr Lee will be working full time to help the company to retain its customers - and its credibility in the market.Mr Oeni, 50, had a 16-year career with HP before striking out in 1996 to set up his own company.Mr Lee, who has more than 30 years of experience in contract manufacturing, was the CEO of Omni Industries until it was acquired by United States-based Celestica in 2001.“The company is still there. It is largely intact. What we have to do now is to rev up the engines and get it started again,” said Dr Lim.With the entry of the white knights, Dr Lim is hoping that business will pick up. “There is business currently, but the ... volume is not the same as what it had been before.”The focus of the new management team is to talk to the company’s customers, suppliers and bankers and get it back on its feet, he added.Citiraya, which has been suspended from trading since late January, is under investigation by the Commercial Affairs Department and the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau.Customers have suspended dealings and banks have frozen the company’s credit lines while they await the outcome of the probes.Dr Lim said there was no indication how long the investigations would take. He also said that Mr Ng, the former CEO, is still uncontactable.And even though Mr Koh’s investment consortium is tightening its grip with the appointment of full-time executives to run Citiraya, Dr Lim was still hopeful that there will be counter-bids, as “people are still talking to us”.Mr Koh’s investment consortium plans to take a 70 per cent stake in the enlarged capital of Citiraya, subject to a three-month due diligence on the company.Some investors are unhappy over the proposal as the new shares could be offered to the consortium at between 12 and 25 cents each, depending on valuation calculations. Citiraya last traded at $1.08 when it was suspended.But Dr Lim had earlier argued that Citiraya’s shareholders would be the ones to ultimately decide the outcome at an extraordinary general meeting to approve any rescue plan. Who’s in and who’s out IN- White knights Koh Boon Hwee and Low Check Kian, who last month proposed plans to inject up to $100 million into Citiraya, will join the company’s board as non-executive directors. - Mr Lee Kim Bock fills the new post of president. His duties cover operations and business growth. OUT- Mr Ng Teck Lee has been out of contact for several weeks and is believed to have left Singapore. - Two officers linked to the previous management - chief financial officer Gan Chin Chin and chief operating officer Richard Basil Jacob - have resigned as directors.

The probes started five months ago.Talk began to swirl in the market then that illegal trading of e-waste parts was going on at the firm.Citiraya has not responded to the allegations of the existence of illegal trading.The company’s spokesman said yesterday: ‘The advisers of the company are currently carrying out their investigation with the view to preparing a report relating to the matter, which they will issue to the board when the report is finalised. The company will then make the appropriate announcement. The company is not in a position to make any statement at the moment.’Shares of Citiraya have been suspended from trading since January. As well as police probes, it faces legal suits from creditors and a dwindling cash reserve. Indeed, it appears to have had high operating and overhead costs.According to its most recent financial statement, the firm had total expenses amounting to $10.9 million in the nine-month period ended Sept 30 last year.This could also be due to its practice of paying ‘premium prices’ to secure e-waste supply from its customers.It is believed that Citiraya could have paid between $2,000 and $3,000 for every tonne of e-waste collected, regardless of its recycling value.Market observers reckoned that this practice had enabled Citiraya to dominate the e-waste market, pushing other competitors to the sidelines.But sources wondered if, in order to cover its high business costs, Citiraya could have traded the bulk of its e-waste collected, instead of crushing and recycling it.In fact, trading e-waste is far more profitable than recycling it, they said.For instance, a barrel of uncrushed cellphone chips could be worth $1 million, whereas a barrel of crushed ones might only be worth $10,000, they added.That is because there is a demand for these uncrushed chips in markets such as China, where older handsets are still being used.And this could boost Citiraya’s turnover, if this is true.In the nine months ended Sept 30, the firm reported total revenue of about $111 million.The strong performance was largely due to the spectacular growth in its trading activities, which rose by 77 per cent to $36.7 million from the previous nine-month period.Adding to Citiraya’s woes of late was a failed rescue plan by white knights Koh Boon Hwee and Low Check Kian.And its competitors, such as SembCorp Environmental Management, are aggressively snapping up its customers.Further complicating matters is the disappearance of former chief executive Ng Teck Lee, who has been uncontactable up to now.\n\n\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.CPIBFinancial crimesThanks for sharing!"}

Businessman Oei Hong Leong is investing a similar amount.Heshe shareholders will vote on the proposal at a meeting on Sept 26, one day after Citiraya investors vote on the same proposal. If it gets the green light as expected, Citiraya – now in judicial management – may get back on its feet.Approval will also mean changing Citiraya’s name to Centillion Environment & Recycling and Heshe’s to Equation Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch up on the news that everyone’s talking about\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch of the nature of the Citiraya scam has been revealed in the several court cases that have occurred since the firm had its shares suspended in January last year, after the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau started an investigation.Former chief executive Ng Teck Lee has disappeared while 11 people, including his brother Teck Boon, have been jailed so far.But the nTan report gives for the first time, an overall picture of the problems at the firm, which processed and recycled electronic parts that it had bought. Precious metals obtained were then sold.nTan says that “fraudulent activities were both pervasive and of extensive proportions”.It cited the example where Citiraya booked sales of the adhesive epoxy at $230 per kg, when it in fact has no commercial value.Other signs that the transactions were not genuine: The customer could not be found at the address on the invoice; or the same materials were bought repeatedly.nTan said the results for the nine months ended Sept 30, 2004, in which the firm claimed profit before tax of $22.7 million, were “almost entirely inaccurate”.Boosting sales was just one part of the deception; understating costs was also prevalent.When Citiraya bought electronic parts for recycling, suppliers were paid based on an assayer’s estimate of the precious metal component. But Citiraya would tamper with the result, or add non-precious metal to the sample to reduce that precious metal component.Suppliers were likely underpaid to the tune of $9 million between 2003 and last year.As well, two investments in GES and P-Com Systems in 2004, totalling $53.1 million, are now “well below the purchase price paid”.Citiraya was also in the business of crushing electronic chips and extracting the precious metals.But nTan found that between 2003 and last year, 473,281 kg of these electronic metals were “diverted” – that is, not crushed at all.Ng Teck Boon has been jailed over his role in bribing ex-Citiraya employees and suppliers so as to divert these chips for sale in the black market overseas.nTan said the people behind the scam “were obviously in a hurry to show substantial and rapid growth in turnover and profits”. One result was the “rapid and spectacular increase in...Citiraya’s shares”.The report also slammed the lack of internal controls at Citiraya, where accounting records were unreliable. It recommended a corporate governance committee to establish internal controls and proper whistle-blowing procedures.\n\n\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.CPIBFinancial crimesThanks for sharing!"}

VijayanPUBLISHED Dec 04, 2024, 05:00 AMThanks for sharing!This article was first published in The Straits print edition on Aug 15, 2008.Three years after Ng Teck Lee fled the country with money he pocketed while running waste recycling company Citiraya, it has now surfaced just how much he amassed and how he did it.In all, investigators believe he skipped town with US$51 million (S$72 million), made from selling used computer chips which the recycler should have destroyed.This makes the fraud one of Singapore’s biggest ever corporate scandals.The Attorney-General is now trying to forfeit about $28 million worth of assets here – shares, bank accounts, insurance policies and proceeds from the sale of three houses – all traced to Ng’s ill-gotten gains.Trying to block the Attorney-General’s attempts are former creditors of Citiraya and a relative of Ng’s, according to court documents filed.Ng amassed the US$51 million over two years. With the help of his brother Teck Boon, he swiped some 62 containers of electronic scrap between 2003 and 2004 and had them shipped to buyers in Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch up on the news that everyone’s talking about\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe placed the profits into two Hong Kong accounts and used them to buy shares, property and make other purchases.It all ended in January 2005, when Taiwan police raided the premises of some firms there which bought the goods from Ng.The authorities there were apparently alerted when scrap chips that belonged to one of Citiraya’s US-based clients surfaced in Taiwan when the items should have been crushed and recycled in Singapore.Ng fled Singapore the same month. He is currently on Interpol’s wanted list while his brother Teck Boon, who was Citiraya’s former assistant general manager, is currently serving an eight-year jail term after being convicted in 2005 for his part in the scam.In going after Ng’s assets, the Attorney-General is applying to the High Court to seize his ill-gotten gains under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act. It is believed that this is the first time the Act is being invoked for a case not linked to drugs or corruption offences. But the intent is similar – to prevent Ng from getting his hands on assets purchased with money made from illegal acts, like in the case of a heroin trafficker’s drug money.The Attorney-General will come up against Citiraya’s former judicial managers Ernst & Young, who are fighting the claim on behalf of the firm’s creditors. They maintain that the money should go to them as the chips were originally owned by the firm.Represented by lawyers from Allen & Gledhill, they add that Ng failed in his duties as CEO by committing fraud against the firm.Among the assets being fought over are three bank accounts and 11 life insurance policies owned by Ng’s wife Thor Chwee Hwa, valued at some $1.19 million.Former Citiraya CEO Ng Teck Lee made millions by selling computer chips sent to him to be destroyed.PHOTO: BT FILENg is also understood to have transferred some $4.25 million from a Hong Kong account to his wife, a homemaker, in 2003.The present whereabouts of Madam Thor are not known and she is believed to have left the country sometime after Ng fled.The couple were also joint owners of two houses in Binjai Park and Paya Lebar Crescent valued at $15.6 million.Resisting the Attorney-General’s move to seize Madam Thor’s 60 per cent share of a second Paya Lebar Crescent house is her brother Thor Beng Huat.Through lawyer Kertar Singh, the businessman argues that he has a 40 per cent stake in the property and has paid the mortgage instalments for the past three years. His mother and other siblings are presently living in the Paya Lebar unit, which is the family home.Pre-trial hearings have been ongoing in the High Court and the next session is due early next month.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.CPIBFinancial crimesThanks for sharing!"}

He is now on Interpol’s wanted list and his whereabouts are unknown.The Public Prosecutor wanted to convince the court that about $28 million of the tycoon’s assets should be seized.But Justice Kan Ting Chiu decided that about $4 million should be set aside due to competing claims by the recycling firm that replaced Citiraya, a Malaysian businessman, and Ng’s brother-in-law.

It was frozen by the prosecution after the tycoon fled the country, but Mr Ung claimed he should be allowed to keep it.Justice Kan ruled that the question of who was entitled to the money should be decided at a separate hearing.Ng’s wife will also hold on to her share of the family’s home after the judge ruled that it had not been bought with the proceeds of crime.Madam Thor Chwee Hwa – who is believed to have left the country shortly after her husband – owns 60 per cent of the $3 million house in Paya Lebar Crescent. The rest is owned by Ng’s brother-in-law Thor Beng Huat. He argued that he should be entitled to her share, but the court disagreed.Justice Kan ordered that a receiver be appointed to liquidate Ng’s assets, which were approved for seizure under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act.Ng is not the only criminal who has been stripped of millions of dollars by the State. In 2000, Singapore Airlines clerk Teo Cheng Kiat had assets worth about $22 million seized after he was handed a 24-year jail sentence for stealing around $35 million from his employer over several years.\n\n\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.CPIBFinancial crimesThanks for sharing!"}

She is appealing against her sentence at a court in Ho Chi Minh City, with the ruling expected in the coming days.In her final remarks before the court, Lan said: “My only thought is on how to repay the debt to the SBV (State Bank of Vietnam) and the people. I don’t think about the damage to myself and my family. “I feel pained due to the waste of national resources.” She added that she felt “very embarrassed to be charged with this crime”. “Please reconsider and reduce my sentence,” she asked the court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet exclusive insights on Malaysia weekly\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Vietnamese law, Lan could escape the death penalty if she proactively returns three-quarters of the embezzled assets and is judged to have cooperated sufficiently with the authorities.But prosecutors argued on Nov 25 that she had not met the conditions and emphasised that her crime’s consequences were “huge and without precedent”.Among key points being debated in court is an estimate of Lan’s personal wealth.Lan, who founded real estate development group Van Thinh Phat, told the court that “the quickest way” to repay the stolen funds would be “to liquidate SCB, and sell our assets to repay SBV and the people”.Tens of thousands of people who had invested their savings in SCB lost money, shocking the communist nation and prompting rare protests from the victims – who demonstrated again on Nov 26 outside the State Bank of Vietnam in Hanoi.  The State Bank said in April that it pumped funds into SCB to stabilise it, without revealing the amount.During her first trial in April, Lan was found guilty of embezzling US$12.5 billion, but prosecutors said the total damages caused by the scam amounted to US$27 billion – equivalent to around 6 per cent of the country’s 2023 gross domestic product.A total of 47 other defendants have requested reduced sentences at the appeal, which began in early November.In October, Lan was convicted of money laundering and jailed for life in a separate case.

Chinese national Chen Binjue, 41, who was then heading public relations firm Dionysuss Lifestyle, was sentenced to two years and four months’ jail on Nov 5. The Singapore permanent resident had pleaded guilty to one count of dealing with the benefits of criminal conduct. Eight other charges for offences including forgery were considered during sentencing.The prosecution said that almost all the money, save for around $3,000, has been returned to the victim – a firm based in the United Kingdom. Chen incorporated Dionysuss Lifestyle in 2016, but a search with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority on Nov 5 revealed she is no longer a director at the company.In 2019, she got involved in a scheme with a money laundering syndicate made up of unknown people from China.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch up on the news that everyone’s talking about\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Kathy Chu told the court: “She agreed to allow Dionysuss’ (bank account) in Singapore to be used to receive the syndicate’s monies. “She had reasonable grounds to believe the syndicate was engaged in criminal conduct and that its monies were benefits of (crime).”On June 25, 2019, a director at a firm called International Data Corporation UK (IDC UK) fell victim to a phone impersonation scam when a person pretending to be his superior contacted him.The director was told to make arrangements for a transaction as part of IDC UK’s “business acquisition” and that a lawyer would be in touch with him.A person who pretended to be a lawyer then contacted the director, who was asked to arrange for a transaction of US$952,000 to Dionysuss Lifestyle’s Maybank account.The director gave instructions for the transaction to take place and the money was deposited in the account the next day.On June 27, 2019, $296,639 was transferred from the account to a Hong Kong company called New Ginwa.Maybank Singapore was later alerted about the ill-gotten gains in Dionysuss Lifestyle’s bank account.

These quick-fire deals involved small trades that were placed and cancelled within seconds to spoof the market prices in the trading system.Oh repeated the ruse 215 times between August 2020 and March 2021, resulting in $255,385 in illicit gains. On Oct 28, Oh, a 46-year-old Singaporean, was sentenced by District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang to nine months in jail in the biggest case of stock market price spoofing detected in SGX.From 2005 to 2009, Oh worked as a dealer at brokerages UOB Kay Hian, Credit Suisse Securities (Singapore) and Citigroup Global Markets Singapore Securities where he honed his stock market trading skills.He was also a web developer and had been unemployed since 2018.He hatched his plan to manipulate SGX stock prices some time before August 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch up on the news that everyone’s talking about\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo do so, he set up two accounts: a trading account with OCBC Securities to trade shares on SGX and a trading account with brokerage IG Asia that offers, among its specialist products, the trading of contracts for differences (CFD).In CFD trading, a person can trade on the price movements of shares without actually buying or selling them. It was the main tool in Oh’s deception.Court papers described how Oh manipulated or spoofed the prices of shares in a series of methodical moves that he took just seconds to execute each time.To lower the price of a counter, he would first use his OCBC account to sell small quantities of 100 to 200 shares at prices below what buyers were offering to pay.This would artificially lower the market price in the trading system, sometimes by just a fraction of a cent. With the price dip, he would then switch to his IG Asia account to buy a CFD from IG Asia at the artificial low price. Oh would switch back to his OCBC account, cancel the sell order and instead place a buy order for 100 to 200 shares of the same counter at a higher price than sellers were selling, thus artificially pushing up the market price.He would then switch to his IG Asia account and sell the CFD back to IG Asia at a higher price than what he bought just seconds earlier, pocketing the price difference as profit. As a final step, he would cancel the buy order in his OCBC account as he had no intention of completing it. “The accused was well aware that he would be profiting at the expense of IG Asia by manipulating the CFD pricing mechanism. IG Asia would not have fulfilled the accused’s CFD trades if they had known that the market prices were not influenced by genuine market demand and supply in the underlying counter,” according to court papers.More on this TopicProsecution calls Goh Jin Hian ‘mastermind’ of New Silkroutes market-rigging schemeJPMorgan traders found guilty of manipulating gold market for yearsCourt documents named the six SGX counters that Oh targeted: Bonvests Holdings, Bund Center Investment, GSH Corporation, Hotel Properties, Sinarmas Land and The Straits Trading Company. These counters were targeted as they were illiquid, the court papers noted.The bulk of his ill-gotten gains came from 119 instances involving the Bund Center Investment counter, netting him $201,159.Between August 2020 and January 2022, Oh withdrew $175,810 from his CFD trading account at IG Asia and transferred the money into his personal bank accounts at POSB and OCBC.He made occasional withdrawals from his POSB account for his living expenses. After he was arrested and charged in 2023, the police froze the $130,198 in his IG Asia and OCBC accounts when he was under investigation.Oh pleaded guilty to two charges under the Securities and Futures Act for the trades that he made with Bund Center Investment and Sinarmas Land.Four other charges for the trades for the remaining counters were taken into consideration during sentencing.During sentencing, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) David Koh asked the State Courts to sentence Oh to between 11 and 14 months’ jail.“The accused made substantial wrongful gain at the expense of IG Asia,” said DPP Koh in his written submissions, adding: “The offences were also carried out with substantial premeditation and planning.”Oh’s lawyers Nicolas Tang and Jolene Gwee from Farallon Law Corporation argued for him to be jailed for 16 to 24 weeks.The police said on Oct 29 that Oh’s conviction was the result of a joint investigation carried out by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) of the Singapore Police Force and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), following a referral from the Singapore Exchange Regulation.In March 2017, former DBS Vickers trader Dennis Tey Thean Yang was sentenced to 16 weeks in prison for spoofing the securities market and making a profit of $30,239 from his illicit trades.It was the “first conviction of market misconduct under the joint investigation arrangement with the CAD”, MAS said in a statement then after Tey’s sentencing.The second case occurred in July 2021 when former account manager Ee Cho Lian was sentenced to six weeks’ jail and fined $30,000 for 107 false orders and 60 spoof trades where he made a profit of $24,196.Oh’s conviction and sentencing is the third such reported case, and his illegal $255,385 profit is the largest amount so far. He has since made full restitution to IG Asia.

The firms may resume their equity or bond dealings with Nomura when there are further developments, such as when the brokerage details steps to prevent a recurrence, they said. “As it is up to our clients to make decisions regarding individual transactions, we are not in a position to answer,” a spokesperson for Nomura said in response to queries from Bloomberg News. The trading halts deepen woes for Japan’s biggest brokerage, which has taken hits on multiple fronts after the authorities said in September that an unidentified employee manipulated government bond futures in 2021 by placing large orders without intending to buy or sell all of them.In response, Japan’s Finance Ministry stripped the brokerage of primary dealer privileges at government debt auctions for a month. Many companies, including Toyota Finance, have taken their bond underwriting business elsewhere, leading to a fall in league table rankings and market share for Nomura. Nomura admitted to Japan’s financial regulator that it had manipulated the bond market, following an investigation by the securities watchdog. Chief executive officer Kentaro Okuda apologised earlier in October, in his first public appearance following the allegations.The loss of clients, if only briefly, is a setback for the brokerage that is just returning to profitability after moving past several global missteps, including an almost US$3 billion (S$3.9 billion) loss from the collapse of investment firm Archegos Capital Management. Nomura saw its annual profit grow for the first time since Mr Okuda took charge in 2020.Nomura has said that it will announce if there is any possibility of a material impact on its financial results from the fallout of this incident. The company is scheduled to report earnings for the three months ended September on Nov 1.  Regulatory troubles have prompted Japanese companies to remove brokerages from debt underwriting mandates in the past. Few Japanese companies hired Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities on domestic bond deals for several months after regulators punished it for breaching information firewalls in 2024, Bloomberg-compiled data shows.SMBC Nikko Securities, meanwhile, suffered five straight quarterly losses and only recently returned to profit after a market manipulation scandal. Beyond the loss of business, the brokerage arm of Japan’s second-largest banking group was fined and had to forfeit earnings. Executives also had to take pay cuts. BLOOMBERGMore on this TopicChina’s stock boom may turn to bust as in 2015, Nomura warnsAsia stocks gain, yen falls after Japan says it won’t raise rates when markets unstable; STI up 1.4%\n\n\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.JapanBond/Debt marketFinancial crimesThanks for sharing!"}

Christopher Moh, 66, shared his bank account details with these people despite receiving two warnings from the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD). He did not meet any of the women in person.

Some time at the end of the month, administrative staff at the company noticed that the bank’s letter addressed to Periyasamy had been sent to the firm instead. The firm’s director called him to the firm, handed him the letter, and asked him to return the $25,000. Periyasamy replied that he had used up the amount to pay off his debts.In a police interview in November 2023, he told officers that he had also remitted a portion of the money to his family in India.He requested for more time to return the cash to the woman and proposed a monthly repayment of $1,500.

He had pleaded guilty to two charges under Section 200(1)(a) of the SFA of making false statements to induce others to trade. Another charge under the same section was taken into consideration for sentencing.\rSection 200(1)(a) of the SFA mandates that no person shall – by making or publishing any statement, promise or forecast that he knows (or ought reasonably to have known) to be misleading, false or deceptive – induce, or attempt to induce, another person to deal in capital markets products.Oon’s conviction is the result of a joint investigation by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Commercial Affairs Department of the Singapore Police Force.Investigations were opened against him on the back of referrals by the Singapore Exchange.\rBetween April 30 and Nov 23 in 2020, Oon was found to have made false statements on 10 occasions in two Telegram chat groups, namely “SGX Penny Stocks Discussion” and “SGX-Trade with the Wind”.MAS said these statements were made to induce members of the chat groups to purchase shares in the securities held by Oon, who overstated his target sell price for the securities.

Unauthorised payments of £290,000 (S$496,000) were made to one of the trustees, while money was also spent on room service, spa treatments and cigarettes.

No, during 90 minutes it’s one bad afternoon when they were better.“But I would say – I’m sorry, I want to defend my club, especially in these modern days when everyone is expecting us not to be relegated, to be disappeared off the face of the Earth, the world – that we have better afternoons than the opponents. That’s why we win a lot.”City, who are gunning for a fifth straight title, face 80 breaches of financial rules between 2009 and 2018, plus a further 35 for failing to cooperate with an investigation.The club stand accused of failing to provide accurate financial information, including revenue from sponsors and salary details of managers and players.However, City have vehemently denied any wrongdoing. Former City defender Aymeric Laporte, who won five league titles and the Champions League during his time at the club, told The Daily Mail: “When I was there and the news broke, the sporting director (Txiki Begiristain) and the CEO (Ferran Soriano) came and told all the players and staff that we can all be very calm because not one rule has been broken.” AFPMore on this TopicMikel Arteta urges Arsenal to take next step in Man City showdownMan City innocent until proven guilty, says Pep Guardiola\n\n\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.Manchester CityPep GuardiolaEPLFinancial crimesFootball matchesThanks for sharing!"}

The largest amount he allegedly stole in one payment was A$753,000.Mr Lee, a South Korean citizen who joined CapitaLand in 2018, was dismissed in 2023 for failing to submit the company’s tax documents, according to AFR. His dismissal was unrelated to his alleged scheme to steal company funds, it said.CapitaLand detected the payments only at the end of 2023 when auditors flagged the suspicious transactions. But Mr Lee could not be reached and, according to affidavits filed with Australia’s Federal Court, police believe he has fled to South Korea, AFR reported.Clas’ managers said that the incident will not have an impact on its distribution per stapled security and net tangible assets per stapled security for the financial year ending Dec 31.Stapled securities of Clas was at 96 cents at the close of market on Sept 20.

Criminal defendants face a high bar in getting their convictions overturned, as they must show that trial judges made errors that were significant enough to have affected the verdict.FTX declared bankruptcy in November 2022 after a flurry of customer withdrawals, marking a swift fall from grace from Bankman-Fried, who had earned a reputation as an honest broker in the rough-and-tumble cryptocurrency industry and rose to prominence through lavish philanthropic and political donations.FTX has said its customers will receive 100 per cent recovery on their claims against the company, based on the value of their accounts at the time it filed for bankruptcy. Cryptocurrency prices were lower then than they are now, leaving some customers feeling short-changed.In criminal charges brought in December 2022, prosecutors accused Bankman-Fried of stealing US$8 billion (S$10.38 billion) in customer funds to plug losses at Alameda Research, his crypto-focused hedge fund. At his late 2023 trial, Bankman-Fried admitted to making mistakes running FTX but testified that he never stole funds. He placed much of the blame on other FTX executives.Jurors did not buy his explanation, and convicted him on the two counts of fraud and five counts of conspiracy he faced. In sentencing Bankman-Fried in March, Mr Kaplan said Bankman-Fried knew his actions were wrong but “made a very bad bet about the likelihood of getting caught.” Bankman-Fried is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.

Halawi set another hearing for Thursday, one of the sources said. Salameh's media office has said he would not comment publicly on the case, in line with the law. It said in a statement he had cooperated in the past with more than 20 criminal probes in Beirut and Mount Lebanon, and was cooperating with the investigation after his detention.Salameh has denied previous corruption charges.If the prosecution continues, it would mark a rare case of a serving or retired senior Lebanese official facing accountability in a system which critics say has long shielded the elite.A group of protesters shouted \"Thief!\" as a convoy they believed was transporting Salameh entered the justice ministry building. Some of them struck one of the vehicles with their hands.    Salameh was long feted as a financial wizard in Lebanon but left office with his reputation shredded by corruption charges at home and abroad and the catastrophic collapse of Lebanon's financial system in 2019.MILLIONSJudicial sources told Reuters last week Salameh was suspected of financial misconduct related to commissions worth more than $110 million in a scheme linked to Optimum Invest, a Lebanese firm that offers income brokerage services.Investigators have zeroed in on more than $40 million in suspicious transactions linked to that scheme that made their way from an account at the central bank to an account belonging to Salameh, judicial sources said. Optimum Invest has said it was assisting the judicial authorities in their investigation and providing them with all requested information, and that its dealings with the central bank were conducted in full compliance with the law.The Lebanese authorities have not published the charges.The charges brought against Salameh last week are separate from previous charges of financial crimes linked to Forry Associates, a company controlled by his brother, Raja. The brothers - who deny any wrongdoing - were accused of using Forry to divert $330 million in public funds through commissions.Several European countries including France and Germany have been investigating whether tens of millions of dollars of the funds allegedly embezzled from the central bank were laundered in Europe.    Last year, French and German authorities issued warrants for his arrest. The Munich prosecutor's office said in June that German authorities have cancelled their arrest warrant for technical reasons but were continuing their probe and keeping Salameh's assets frozen.

The prosecution said that a sixth man, identified as Mr Pratik Tamang, 41, is linked to some of the charges. He joined the GC in 2004 and returned to Nepal in February 2022 after his retirement. He is still at large.Deputy Public Prosecutor Brian Tan told the court that some time on or before June 2021, Mr Pratik began offering a money remittance service to the other GC officers within their camp.According to court documents, he later recruited Ganga and Dik to work with him in offering such services. He also engaged Sitaram to help him collect the money.Mr Pratik was already in Nepal when Sitaram worked with him between February and July 2022 to provide an unlawful payment service in Singapore.More on this Topic6 foreigners accused of providing illegal cross-border money transfer services involving over $1.6m  10 years' jail for Gurkha cop who misappropriated over $5m from own communityDPP Tan said: “Under the arrangement, GC officers looking to remit money from Singapore dollars to Nepalese rupees (NPR) from Singapore to Nepal would contact Pratik via his mobile number. “After informing Pratik of the amount in dollars that they were looking to remit back, Pratik would first transfer the equivalent amount in NPR to the remitters’ beneficiaries in Nepal.”He would then ask the remitters to contact Sitaram in Singapore to transfer the equivalent value in dollars to Sitaram’s bank account linked to payment platform PayNow.Nearly $1.6 million involving 111 deposits went through the bank account.After that, Sitaram would arrange to hand over the remittance monies in dollars to Mr Pratik, either by PayNow transfers to the latter’s bank account or in cash to Mr Pratik’s friends.Between February and July 2022, Ganga engaged in a conspiracy with Sitaram and Mr Pratik to offer a cross-border money transfer service. Ganga then collected more than $243,000, which he handed over to Sitaram.Ganga later broke off his arrangement with Sitaram and Mr Pratik and began working on his own. He provided a similar service from August 2022 to March 2023, involving over $383,000.Both Sitaram and Ganga did not make any profit from the remittances.Meanwhile, Dik worked together with Sitaram and Mr Pratik to offer such a service between February and July 2022. He collected nearly $550,000, which he handed to Sitaram, the court heard.He later stopped working with the pair and worked on his own from August 2022 to January 2023, and this offence involved nearly $500,000.The DPP said that Dik earned an estimated profit of between $1,750 and $2,450.Separately, the DPP said that Mingmar committed the offences with his Nepalese wife, Ms Pema Sherpa, 43, who is now based in Canada and is still at large.According to court documents, she started offering a money remittance service to QC officers within their camp in September 2022.More on this TopicOver $1m seized, 7 under probe after raids on alleged unlicensed payment services in Little India Duo allegedly provided unlawful money transfer service, dealing with more than $5.1mDPP said that as Ms Pema needed a bank account to receive the remittance monies, her husband handed over the details of his bank account to her for this purpose.

One of them said the judge was expected to schedule a hearing for early next week.Reuters could not immediately reach a lawyer for Salameh.  Salameh, 73, was the bank governor for 30 years but his final years were marred by the collapse of Lebanon's financial system along with charges of financial crimes, including illicit enrichment through public funds, by authorities in Lebanon and several Western countries.The state-owned National News Agency said prosecutor Ali Ibrahim, to whom the case was referred by public prosecutor Jamal al-Hajjar on Wednesday, charged Salameh with \"embezzlement, theft of public funds, forgery, and illicit enrichment\", before referring the case to investigating judge Bilal Halawi, who will set the date for the hearing.  The authorities have not published the charges against him.Two judicial sources told Reuters on Tuesday that Salameh had been held on charges of accruing more than $110 million via financial crimes involving Optimum Invest, a Lebanese firm that offers income brokerage services. Optimum Invest said in a statement it was \"fully assisting the judicial authorities in their investigation and provided them with all the information and documents previously requested\".The firm said its dealings with the Lebanese central bank  \"were conducted in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\"Neither Salameh nor his lawyer responded to requests for comment on Tuesday. Salameh has previously denied all accusations of financial crimes.Tuesday's charges are separate from previous charges of financial crimes linked to Forry Associates, a company controlled by Salameh's brother, Raja.

REUTERS/Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/File PhotoUPDATED Sep 04, 2024, 04:35 AMThanks for sharing!MEXICO CITY - A report from the United Nations released on Tuesday detailed alleged crimes committed by the government of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, including an intensifying crackdown on dissent enforced with a new wave of arbitrary arrests and torture.Based on 120 interviews with what the U.N. human rights office describes as victims and witnesses of human rights abuses, as well as civil society groups, the report covers just the 12-month period that ended in May. The latest crackdown began over six years ago.The U.N. report provided detailed descriptions of arbitrary detentions, at least two documented enforced disappearances, as well as how freedom of expression and association have been routinely undermined during the period.Citing civil society reports, the report asserts that 131 perceived Ortega opponents have been arbitrarily detained as of last May, marking a sharp increase compared to 54 a year earlier.It notes that another 10 arbitrary arrests were carried out in June and July.The report also includes grisly details of a dozen cases of alleged torture and mistreatment of detainees allegedly committed by the government's security apparatus, including rapes and electric shocks. It notes that three men detained reported strangulation of their testicles.Interviewed torture survivors \"showed visible signs of post-traumatic stress disorder,\" according to the report.\"Detainees and their families were warned against speaking out about torture or conditions of detention and threatened with losing visiting rights,\" it added.Vice President Rosario Murillo, the government's spokesperson and Ortega's wife, did not immediately respond to written questions about the report's findings. Ortega's government in the past has ignored reports from the U.N. and the Organization of American States, which it says are part of an international campaign against it.In public appearances, Ortega has criticized some of his domestic adversaries as mercenaries seeking to overthrow his government.After mass anti-government street protests broke out in 2018, Ortega's security forces launched a violent counterattack in which more than 300 civilians were killed, according to rights groups and international observers.Since then, the government has arrested or expelled scores of Catholic priests, among the crackdown's most high-profile targets, in addition to shuttering several thousand civil society groups, most accused of financial crimes.Critics of Ortega argue he has sought to silence, remove or otherwise repress all voices perceived to be hostile to his government. A former Marxist rebel and Cold War-era U.S.-antagonist, Ortega came to power in 1979 after deposing a right-wing family dictatorship. He is now serving his fourth consecutive term as president.

REUTERS/Mohamed Azakir/ File Photo››UPDATED Sep 03, 2024, 11:10 PMThanks for sharing!BEIRUT - Lebanon's former central bank governor, Riad Salameh, was arrested in Beirut on Tuesday over financial crimes linked to a brokerage company, three judicial sources said, his first arrest after years of accusations.Salameh, 73, was the bank governor for 30 years but his final months were marred by charges of financial crimes including illicit enrichment through public funds by authorities in Lebanon and several other countries.One judicial source told Reuters the specific charges that led to his arrest on Tuesday were embezzlement, money-laundering and fraud as part of commissions earned through the central bank's dealings with Optimum Invest between 2015-2018, a Lebanese firm that offers income brokerage services.Neither Salameh, his lawyer or Optimum responded to requests for comment. Salameh has previously denied any accusations of financial crimes. Tuesday's charges are separate from previous financial crimes with which he was charged linked to Forry Associates, a company controlled by Salameh's brother, Raja. The brothers were accused of using Forry to divert $330 million in public funds through commissions. Despite facing charges in Lebanon, arrest warrants in both France and Germany and an Interpol Red Notice, Salameh had never been apprehended. He will be held for four days as a \"precautionary arrest\" before the case is transferred to the Beirut public prosecutor, another judicial source said. Two of the judicial sources told Reuters on Tuesday that Salameh was arrested following a hearing at Lebanon's justice palace about the central bank's dealings with Optimum Invest. They said Optimum had dealt with Lebanon's central bank to buy and sell treasury bonds and certificates of deposit with quick turnovers to make major profits. Optimum's CEO Reine Abboud told Reuters by phone that the company had not been present at the hearing and heard about the arrest through local media.  Abboud referred Reuters to a statement on Optimum's website that said a financial audit in late 2023 had found \"no evidence of wrongdoing or illegality\" in the company's dealings with the central bank. Lebanon's caretaker justice minister Henry Khoury told Reuters that he did not have details of the file.\"There is no doubt that the Public Prosecutor did what was required of him and interrogated former governor Riad Salameh,\" he said.Caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati told pan-Arab broadcaster Al-Hadath that the government will not intervene in the case. Tuesday's arrest marks a serious reversal for a man who once enjoyed high-level backing from Lebanon's top politicians and was seen as a possible president. After taking the helm of the central bank following a devastating 15-year civil war, Salameh built a reputation as a competent steward of the financial system.His fall mirrors that of Lebanon's financial system, which has collapsed five years into an economic meltdown and now faces an appraisal by a financial watchdog in the coming weeks that could place it on a \"grey list\" warranting additional scrutiny.One of the main gap areas identified by the Financial Action Task Force is a lack of judicial action on alleged financial crimes. A diplomatic and a judicial source said they viewed Salameh's arrest as a potential attempt to try to show FATF appraisers something was now being done.

PHOTO: BT FILEChong Xin WeiUPDATED Aug 29, 2024, 09:18 PMThanks for sharing!SINGAPORE - The former chief executive of mainboard-listed KTL Global, Tan Kheng Yeow, began serving his eight-month jail sentence after the High Court dismissed his appeal in July, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Singapore Police Force (SPF) said in a joint statement on Aug 28.Tan was sentenced to jail by the State Courts on Jan 23 for conspiring with Tang Boon Hai to create a false appearance of active trading in KTL shares.Their actions came amid concerns that KTL was unable to meet the new minimum trading price requirement announced by the Singapore Exchange in 2014.Under the requirement, a mainboard-listed company’s volume-weighted average price (VWAP) over six months cannot fall below 20 cents. Issuers that fail to comply may be delisted.The six-month VWAP of KTL’s shares as at Aug 1, 2014, was below the minimum price required. Hence, between Oct 16, 2014, and Sept 8, 2015, Tan conspired with Tang to create a facade that people were actively buying KTL shares, in order to increase the company’s share price. Tan also held significant quantities of KTL shares and knew that his net worth would increase along with the share price, said MAS and SPF. They highlighted that Tan also arranged for funds to be transferred to Tang to finance trades in KTL shares placed by the latter in 14 trading accounts.Tang was convicted on April 18, 2023, and sentenced to 30 months’ jail. Meanwhile, Tan Chun Yong, a former trading representative from OCBC, was charged on Oct 29, 2020, and court proceedings are still ongoing. Tan Kheng Yeow pleaded guilty to one charge under Section 197(1)(a) of the Securities and Futures Act (SFA) and Section 109 of the Penal Code. He faces two other charges of cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property.KTL shares last closed flat at 11.6 cents on Aug 6, 2021, before a trading halt. The company subsequently applied to turn the halt into a voluntary suspension.  The voluntary suspension came after the branding, operations and procurement company undertook an independent review to look into transactions of its subsidiary Bluegas with four branding, operation and procurement customers in China.\rIn a bourse filing on May 15, 2024, KTL said the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading (SGX-ST) will proceed to delist the company. This came as KTL failed to meet the listing rule requirement and exit the watch list, even after an extension till June 30. The company was placed on the watch list on Dec 4, 2019. This happens when companies record losses for the three latest consecutive financial years and have an average daily market cap of under $40 million over the last six months. As the company will be delisted, KTL or its controlling shareholders must provide a reasonable exit offer to shareholders.   KTL said it would inform SGX-ST about the exit offer as soon as practicable and no later than one month from May 14, which was the date it received the delisting notification.

Shares in Kakao, which have fallen by about a quarter in 2024, slid as much as 5.4 per cent in Seoul on July 23. However, shares in KakaoBank gained about 2 per cent in active morning trade.The conglomerate may have to cut its stake in the online fintech affiliate – making room for other investors – if the courts find Mr Kim guilty.The South Korean authorities have for decades convicted and imprisoned corporate leaders over allegations of graft or other wrongdoing – most recently Mr Jay Y. Lee, now chairman of memory chip and smartphone giant Samsung Electronics.Mr Kim, however, is the first of a new breed of tech entrepreneurs to run afoul of the law.Celebrated for creating a messaging and social media platform that linked online services from banking to webtoons, Mr Kim is facing accusations that he was involved in a stock-rigging scheme during the high-profile takeover of K-pop agency SM Entertainment in 2023. Kakao won a controlling stake in SM after an intense bidding battle with Hybe, the label behind K-pop sensation BTS. Financial regulators have since accused executives at Kakao and unit Kakao Entertainment of buying 240 billion won (S$233 million) in shares of SM at the time, to disrupt Hybe’s offer.Mr Kim and Kakao spokespeople have repeatedly denied the allegations and said no illegal activities transpired during the acquisition of SM.A spokesperson for Kakao declined to comment on the arrest warrant on July 22. Media reports in January 2023 said Singapore’s GIC had agreed to invest 600 billion won in Kakao Entertainment.The warrant is a remarkable turn of events for a self-made billionaire who rose from poverty to build South Korea’s leading internet firm.  Mr Kim – who as a boy shared a room with seven family members – founded the company that would become Kakao in 2006. He started the massively successful KakaoTalk mobile messaging app four years later, which would go on to become the heart of an online empire spanning banking, shopping, gaming and ride-hailing. At one point, he surpassed Samsung’s Mr Lee to become the country’s richest person.But that meteoric ascent also attracted intense scrutiny. Regulators, concerned about Kakao’s widening business reach, instituted measures to safeguard against monopolistic practices.In early 2022, a police investigation into reports that Kim dodged 886 billion won of taxes – stemming from a 2014 merger with rival Daum – wiped out more than US$25 billion (S$33.6 billion) of market value from Kakao and subsidiaries such as Kakao Pay, Kakao Games and KakaoBank. The company has called those allegations “groundless”.More on this TopicKakao investment chief arrested for alleged share rigging in takeover battle for K-pop agencyHow Kakao won a takeover battle against Hybe for K-pop pioneer SM Entertainment Shares in Kakao, the main listed vehicle, have shed some three-quarters of their value since a 2021 lifetime high. Mr Kim’s fortune is now estimated at about US$3.6 billion – a fraction of his peak at north of US$13 billion. But his group is still the country’s 15th largest conglomerate by assets, with 124 affiliates, according to data from the Fair Trade Commission and the company. The latest scandal has ensnared not just Mr Kim, but a number of his lieutenants. The South Korean authorities previously arrested Kakao’s chief investment officer Bae Jae-hyun over the bidding war for SM Entertainment. It is unclear what Mr Kim’s involvement in that case might have been. In March, Ms Shina Chung, the former head of its corporate venture-capital arm, became chief executive officer to lead the firm out of crisis.

We hope that this process will address the Commission's concerns,\" the spokesperson said.    Critics say changes Fico has spearheaded since his election last year, such as the criminal code overhaul and revamping a public broadcaster, have hurt the rule of law and media freedoms. Fico has also faced criticism for ending state military aid to Ukraine and leaning too close to Russia.Fico, who accuses the opposition of trying to damage Slovakia's standing with its criticism, has been recovering after being shot four times at close range by an attacker in mid-May, which left him needing hours of surgery. He appeared in public for the first time since the attack on July 5, speaking at a state ceremony in which he railed against progressive ideologies, and has attended government meetings since then.

On July 9, one of them, Ishan Sharma, 34, was sentenced to four weeks’ jail. He had pleaded guilty to two charges under the Companies Act after instigating his friend Kandhiban Letchumanansamy, 36, into not exercising reasonable diligence when the latter was a director at both firms.Kandhiban was sentenced to a week’s jail. He pleaded guilty to one charge under the same Act after he failed to exercise any supervision over the companies’ affairs.Both men are Singaporeans.Court documents did not state how the offences came to light.Stressing that Sharma was the “directing mind” behind these arrangements, Deputy Public Prosecutor Matthew Choo told the court that the offender earned $12,000 in total for his offences linked to the two companies that received more than US$1 million from scam victims.At the time of the offences between 2019 and 2020, Sharma was a chartered accountant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch up on the news that everyone’s talking about\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, he found out that Kandhiban was unemployed and offered the older man a job at a firm called Karmic Circle, with a monthly salary of $500.As part of the arrangement, Kandhiban had to be listed as a director of incorporated companies. He agreed to the deal.DPP Choo said: “Kandhiban knew that he was meant to be a ‘silent director’ and would have nothing to do with the operations or activities of the companies. “Kandhiban also did not perform any due diligence on the companies prior to incorporation, relying on Ishan (Sharma), who informed him that he had supposedly conducted due diligence checks on the companies. There were no supervisory structures in place post-incorporation.”Due to his arrangement with Sharma, Kandhiban became the listed director of more than 50 companies between 2019 and 2020.Some time before June 2019, a man known as Aashish Nanda introduced Sharma to Indian national Rahul Batra, the court heard.Aashish also told Sharma that Rahul wanted to incorporate a company in Singapore.Sharma then corresponded with Rahul twice over the phone before he proceeded with the incorporation of Quartz Resources.

Kandhiban understood from Sharma that Quartz Resources was purportedly in the business of infocomm technology consultation, software development and sales. The agreement included a clause stating that Kandhiban should not be involved in the firm’s management and operations.Quartz Resources was incorporated on June 7, 2019, and Sharma’s home was listed as its registered office address. Kandhiban and Rahul were listed as its directors, while Sharma was listed as its secretary.Later that month, three corporate bank accounts were opened under Quartz Resources’ name, with Rahul as their sole signatory.The DPP said Kandhiban did not have access to the bank statements, did not request the statements, and did not review the transactions performed through the accounts.More on this TopicFirm fined $50k after its bank account was used to receive scam proceeds totalling nearly $2mNominee director fined after firm’s bank account was used to receive $620k in scam proceeds Two of Quartz Resources’ bank accounts later received more than US$583,000 from five scam victims.Sharma and Kandhiban went on to commit similar offences linked to Kiora Worldwide, which was incorporated on Nov 3, 2019.For this case, the court heard that some time before November 2019, Aashish introduced Sharma to another Indian national, identified as Wadhawan Suchit.Sharma met Wadhawan in person only in November 2019, after the incorporation of Kiora Worldwide.

Raja Kumar said Singapore had focused on addressing contemporary challenges in combating illicit finance over its term of presidency at the watchdog. ST PHOTO: AZMI ATHNIAndrew WongUPDATED Jun 28, 2024, 11:39 PMThanks for sharing!SINGAPORE - The virtual asset sector, which includes cryptocurrencies, is at high risk of being exploited for money laundering and terrorism financing activities, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) said. Speaking at the close of its plenary sessions in Singapore on June 28, FATF president T. Raja Kumar said the sector remains poorly regulated in many countries.The global financial watchdog had issued global, binding standards to prevent the misuse of virtual assets for money laundering and terrorist financing.However, about 75 per cent – or 97 – of 130 countries with significant virtual asset and virtual asset service provider activities remain only partially or are not compliant with the standards.FATF said gaps in the global regulatory system have created significant loopholes that can be exploited by criminals, terrorists and rogue regimes. Said Mr Raja: “Countries urgently need to prevent further abuse by criminals on this sector. Many countries are acting too slow on this, but the reality is we can’t allow terrorists to raise funds or organised crime groups to launder funds in an unregulated space.”According to FATF standards, countries need to license or register virtual asset service providers and supervise the sector, in the same way they supervise other financial institutions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch up on the news that everyone’s talking about\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, virtual asset service providers are required to implement the same preventive measures as those of financial institutions, including exercising due diligence on customers, keeping records and reporting suspicious transactions.They also have to be able to identify and hold “originator and beneficiary information” when making transfers.FATF said it will publicly identify jurisdictions with a significant stake in virtual assets in order to push for higher standards in the mostly unregulated space. “We have been exhorting countries to essentially learn from those jurisdictions that have made progress on this front, to then learn off them and essentially take on board best practices to then review the legislation,” said Mr Raja at a press conference held at the end of the plenary sessions. The watchdog noted that the number of jurisdictions that are compliant or largely compliant with its standards on virtual assets has increased to 33 in 2024, from 25 the year before.However, many others have not acted with enough expediency.“The FATF calls on all jurisdictions to act rapidly and fully implement the FATF’s requirements on virtual assets and virtual asset providers,” the watchdog said, adding that it will monitor the situation and ensure countries have support to implement the requirements.More on this TopicAsset recovery a priority in Singapore’s anti-money laundering regime: PM Wong Law to be amended to detect and prosecute money launderers more effectivelyOver two days from June 26, FATF led sessions attended by delegates from more than 200 jurisdictions and observers from international organisations such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and United Nations.The event was held at the Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre.Singapore will reach the end of its two-year presidential term at the financial watchdog at the end of June. It has been a member of FATF since 1992. Mr Raja said Singapore had focused on addressing contemporary challenges in combating illicit finance over its term of presidency.   “The work that we have done on asset recovery, beneficial ownership transparency and virtual assets over the past few years – they all mutually reinforce each other by giving law enforcement and national authorities more tools in this fight.“Countries can now lift the veil and find out where criminals are hiding their dirty money, including virtual assets, and go after it to ensure that crime does not pay,” he added.In November 2023, FATF introduced new requirements for countries to establish asset recovery as a priority, both at the domestic and international levels, and to periodically review their confiscation policies and operational frameworks.Among other things, countries are to enforce laws that would deprive criminals of assets from a criminal lifestyle, or that exceed their known lawful income.They are also obliged to recognise one another’s preliminary and final court orders concerning assets subject to confiscation, which FATF said reflect the reality of transnational money laundering investigations.Singapore has made asset recovery a priority in its national anti-money laundering regime, releasing its first National Asset Recovery Strategy on June 26.The approach sets out how Singapore will deprive criminals of their illicit funds and assets, remove the financial incentives for criminals to launder their illicit proceeds in Singapore, and return these assets to victims.At the press conference, Mr Raja announced that FATF members had approved revised criteria for prioritising countries in its International Cooperation Review Group review process. It could result in countries with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing deficiencies being placed on FATF’s black or grey list automatically. The black list identifies countries or jurisdictions with serious strategic deficiencies in countering money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing of weapons of mass destruction. The grey list is for countries that are actively working with FATF to address the strategic deficiencies. But the financial watchdog will take into account the challenges faced by the least developed countries, with members that fall into this category being given more time to work on their action plans, he added.

There are no partners.Investigations revealed that between 2018 and 2019, the three men were separately introduced to an unidentified individual in Singapore by a 35-year-old man to be part of a consultancy business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch up on the news that everyone’s talking about\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the business, the three men set up their sole proprietorships and opened bank accounts to receive and withdraw money from purported clients, said the police.The 35-year-old man had allegedly acted as an intermediary, relaying instructions from the unidentified individual to the three men, who would then be able to keep a portion of the money they received, and give the balance to the intermediary.The 35- and 39-year-old men had also allegedly conspired to cheat the bank by submitting a fake invoice, payment voucher and quotation, when asked by the bank about a withdrawal of $279,740 from the account.The 35-year-old man who allegedly acted as a middleman will be charged with one count of abetment to commit money laundering, one count of abetment to cheat a bank, and two counts of money laundering.The three other men will be charged with a total of three counts of money laundering, one count of abetment to commit money laundering, and one count of abetment to cheat a bank.More on this Topic3 men arrested for conspiring to cheat woman of money using fake gold ingotsTeenagers among 9 arrested for suspected involvement in money mule activitiesJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Money launderingCheatingFinancial crimesPoliceThanks for sharing!"}

The transfers were all made to bank accounts in the accused’s name.” Chua then told the victim that the so-called trading account used for one of the latter’s “investments” had been frozen.He instructed the man to contact his friend “Khun Nai”, claiming he was a broker who could purportedly arrange for the withdrawal of the victim’s investment monies. Posing as Khun Nai, Chua later instructed the unsuspecting victim to transfer sums of money on 25 occasions between Dec 17, 2022, and Jan 31, 2023. The transfers were made to either Chua’s bank account, or to those used by gambling websites to top up Chua’s gambling accounts.DPP Lim said: “The accused lied that the transfers were necessary to enable the victim to withdraw his investment monies, or to pay fees, or to settle other issues relating to the investment. Believing this, the victim made the transfers accordingly.”In total, Chua duped the sixth victim into transferring more than $87,600. Chua has made no restitution to him.Separately, the court heard that Chua had also worked as a consultant at a travel agency.Between September and October 2019, he asked six of its customers to pay for their tour packages through methods such as cash transfers to his personal bank accounts.These customers paid a total of $22,400 to Chua, who made off with the money. He then used the amount to pay off his gambling debts.One of the customers later contacted the travel agency, stating that he did not receive some items, including an itinerary.The agency conducted an internal investigation and Chua’s employment was terminated on Oct 31, 2019. One of its representatives alerted the police the next day.

The 36-year-old Vanuatu national, who is originally from China, pleaded guilty on June 6 to money laundering and forgery. Another 12 charges were taken into consideration. They range from forgery and money laundering to manpower-related offences for hiring a personal chef without a valid work pass. District Judge James Elisha Lee on June 10 said Su demonstrated a high degree of disregard for the law in Singapore, with the charges showing that he persistently committed the acts over a significant period of time. As part of his sentence, Su agreed to forfeit $178.9 million of his assets to the state. His forfeited assets represent 95.5 per cent of the $187 million fortune seized from him and his wife Chen Qiuyan. At the conclusion of Su’s sentencing, Mr Tan Kiat Pheng, chief prosecutor of the Attorney-General’s Chambers, said in a statement that the amounts involved make this one of the largest money laundering cases that have been prosecuted in the nation. Said Mr Tan: “The swift prosecution of these 10 cases is a strong message to would-be criminals that Singapore will not tolerate attempts to flout our laws. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch up on the news that everyone’s talking about\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We will take firm and swift action against those who exploit our system to launder illicit gains or commit white-collar crimes.”Court documents showed that just after the couple relocated to Singapore in August 2020, they amassed a portfolio of assets that included 12 properties worth $63.9 million and seven vehicles worth $5.2 million.To explain his wealth, Su deceived two banks in Singapore by submitting a number of property sales contracts despite knowing that they were false.Two of the contracts, which he submitted to Maybank Singapore, were for the sale of DC The Grand property number 5101 and property number 3009 to someone named Li Bao. A third contract, which was also given to Maybank, was for the sale of Residences_E2 property number 2302 to Lin Zhenghu. Su claimed that deposits of $1,029,970 and $969,970 made by a firm named Tuo Xin You were proceeds from the sale of the property.A fourth contract was for Address Boulevard property number 3101 – purportedly sold to Wong Hiuluen – which Su submitted to OCBC Bank.A fifth contract, which was also handed to OCBC, was for the sale of Emaar Square Bldg 2 property number 408 to Zhou Weihong.Su claimed that a deposit of $2,999,980 made by Wecord Rich Trading Company was from the sale of the property.He had also submitted two loan agreements to OCBC that he knew were forged.In court, Su claimed to have made money as a real estate agent in Dubai.

The bulk of the properties were luxury units marketed by Fidu Properties, including The Grand at Dubai Creek and Grande Downtown Dubai.Su himself had bought 30 properties in Dubai, the leak showed, although ST could independently verify only 12 properties worth more than $21 million in total.They include apartments at the Burj Khalifa, once the world’s tallest building, and a villa in District One Villas Phase Two, just minutes away from Crystal Lagoon.After Su’s arrest by Singapore’s Commercial Affairs Department (CAD), police found he had 12 properties here, seven luxury vehicles, tens of millions of dollars in cash and in bank accounts, and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency.Su told police investigators that he also owned 11 “condominium rooms”, two offices and a villa worth a total of 30 million dirham in Dubai.More on this Topic$3b money laundering probe widens: 17 other foreigners linked to bulk of cash, assets seizedUntangling the complex web behind S’pore’s biggest money laundering caseIn a statement released on June 10, the police said the total value of assets linked to the 10 convicted foreigners that have been seized and issued with prohibition disposal orders amounts to more than $1 billion.Of that amount, more than $940 million in assets has been forfeited from the 10 convicted foreigners in the case.  The authorities on June 5 said the bulk of the $3 billion in cash and assets involved in the money laundering case belong to 17 other individuals who remain on the run. In the June 10 statement, the police said they will maintain custody of the assets associated with the 17 until they have been dealt with by the court.The prosecution had sought a jail term of between 17 and 18 months for Su, who it said laundered some $17.5 million in Singapore. It added that Su opted to plead guilty only because it would mean less time behind bars, after he learnt about the sentences meted out to the other nine implicated in the case.  In a written judgment published on June 10, the judge said Su’s offences were premeditated and have undermined the integrity of Singapore’s financial system.“The role and ability of banks and financial institutions to detect and report suspicious transactions and deposits is an important component in the anti-money laundering framework in Singapore. “The accused’s act strikes directly at this critical function. The effect is not confined to frustration of the banks’ ability to ascertain the true sources of funds. “It also impacts adversely on the overall ability of Singapore, as a reputable financial hub, to effectively carry out its anti-money laundering responsibilities,” said the judge. Of the others convicted, Su Wenqiang, Su Haijin, Su Baolin, Wang Baosen, Vang Shuiming, Zhang Ruijin, Chen Qingyuan and Lin Baoying were jailed for between 13 and 15 months each.Wang Dehai was sentenced to 16 months in jail.  Four of them – Su Wenqiang, Wang Baosen, Su Baolin and Su Haijin – were deported to Cambodia between May 6 and 28. Vang was deported to Japan on June 1. CAD director David Chew said in a statement on June 10: “Our swift and firm law enforcement efforts and the successful prosecutions of these 10 offenders are testament to our commitment to tackle transnational crime and disrupt the activities of organised crime syndicates. “In Singapore, these criminals will not find safe harbour for themselves or their wealth.”More on this Topic$3b money laundering case: 10 convicted, 17 on the run; police are after the rest askST: Are sentences in $3 billion money laundering case short relative to the sums involved?

His daughter, Ms Marianne Boesky, said he died in his sleep.An inspiration for the character Gordon Gekko in director Oliver Stone’s film Wall Street and its sequel, Mr Boesky made a fortune betting on stock tips, often passed to him illegally in exchange for suitcases of cash. His guilty plea to insider trading in November 1986 and his US$100 million penalty, a record at the time, sent shock waves through Wall Street and set off a cascade of events that marked the end of a decade of frenzied takeover activity and the celebration of conspicuous wealth.As US investigators closed in on Mr Boesky, he agreed to cooperate, providing information that led to the downfall of investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert and its junk bond king, Mr Michael Milken.Mr Boesky brought an aggressive style to the once-sleepy world of arbitrage, the buying and selling of stocks in companies that appear to be takeover targets. Sniffing out impending deals, he amassed stock positions at levels never seen before.At the top of his game in the mid-1980s, he had a net worth of US$280 million – about US$818 million (S$1.1 billion) in today’s currency – and a trading portfolio valued at US$3 billion (about US$8.7 billion today), much of it financed with borrowed money. Home was a sprawling estate in Westchester County, New York, its main house adorned with a Pierre-Auguste Renoir painting and carpets embossed with his monogram “IFB”. Besides a Manhattan pied-a-terre, there was a retreat on the French Riviera, a lavish Paris apartment and a condo in Hawaii. Through his first wife, Ms Seema Boesky, he was part owner of the celebrated Beverly Hills Hotel, a lush pink concoction favoured by Hollywood stars as well as by titans of finance attending the Predators’ Ball, Drexel Burnham’s annual get-together.‘Greed is healthy’On Wall Street, it was a decade born of greed. Fuelled by the easy money of junk bonds, a small group of kingmakers – including Mr Carl Icahn, Mr T. Boone Pickens, Mr James Goldsmith, Mr Saul Steinberg, Mr Boesky and Mr Milken – became fabulously wealthy by engaging in schemes of financial engineering and corporate raids that drove the stock market to dizzying levels before its crash in 1987.Mr Boesky embraced the go-go ethos of the time. “Greed is all right, by the way,” he told business school students at the University of California, Berkeley, in a commencement speech in 1986. “I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself.” He was greeted with rousing applause.A year later, those words were immortalised on screen in Wall Street, in which Gekko (played by actor Michael Douglas), an unscrupulous corporate raider, gives his famous “Greed is good” speech.By 1986, Mr Boesky’s world had begun to unravel. In May, when a lower-level Drexel banker, Dennis Levine, was indicted on insider trading charges, federal prosecutors found Mr Boesky’s name in his notes; he had been paying Levine for tips. Hot on Mr Boesky’s trail was US attorney Rudy Giuliani, who had been bringing down Mafia dons and crooked politicians and was now focused on Wall Street malfeasance.On Sept 17, Mr Boesky surrendered to federal investigators. In an appeal for leniency, agreed to become a government informant, wearing a wire when meeting with Mr Milken, who was an even bigger target of federal prosecutors. A quieter lifeIn December 1987, Mr Boesky was sentenced to a three-year prison term. While in prison, he studied the Talmud and earned pocket change by working on a prison cleanup crew. He later admitted to violating prison rules by paying fellow inmates to do his laundry.He emerged from prison in 1990. He was 53. In 1991, his wife of 30 years sued him for divorce. Pleading poverty, he asked for half of her US$100 million fortune; he settled for US$20 million, annual payments of US$180,000 and a US$2.5 million California home.For many years, Mr Boesky lived quietly in La Jolla, where he remarried and became a father again.In addition to his daughter Marianne, he is survived by three sons from his first marriage, William, Theodore and Johnathan; his wife, Ms Ana (Serrano) Boesky; their daughter, Ms Blu Boesky; and four grandchildren.In a 1985 interview with The Washington Post, Mr Boesky gave a remarkably prescient view of his ultimate downfall. “I can’t predict my demise,” he said. “But I suspect it will occur abruptly.” It did. Within a year, he was arrested and charged with insider trading.

His daughter, Ms Marianne Boesky, said he died in his sleep.An inspiration for the character Gordon Gekko in director Oliver Stone’s film Wall Street and its sequel, Mr Boesky made a fortune betting on stock tips, often passed to him illegally in exchange for suitcases of cash. His guilty plea to insider trading in November 1986 and his US$100 million penalty, a record at the time, sent shock waves through Wall Street and set off a cascade of events that marked the end of a decade of frenzied takeover activity and the celebration of conspicuous wealth.As US investigators closed in on Mr Boesky, he agreed to cooperate, providing information that led to the downfall of investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert and its junk bond king, Mr Michael Milken.Mr Boesky brought an aggressive style to the once-sleepy world of arbitrage, the buying and selling of stocks in companies that appear to be takeover targets. Sniffing out impending deals, he amassed stock positions at levels never seen before.At the top of his game in the mid-1980s, he had a net worth of US$280 million – about US$818 million (S$1.1 billion) in today’s currency – and a trading portfolio valued at US$3 billion (about US$8.7 billion today), much of it financed with borrowed money. Home was a sprawling estate in Westchester County, New York, its main house adorned with a Pierre-Auguste Renoir painting and carpets embossed with his monogram “IFB”. Besides a Manhattan pied-a-terre, there was a retreat on the French Riviera, a lavish Paris apartment and a condo in Hawaii. Through his first wife, Ms Seema Boesky, he was part owner of the celebrated Beverly Hills Hotel, a lush pink concoction favoured by Hollywood stars as well as by titans of finance attending the Predators’ Ball, Drexel Burnham’s annual get-together.‘Greed is healthy’On Wall Street, it was a decade born of greed. Fuelled by the easy money of junk bonds, a small group of kingmakers – including Mr Carl Icahn, Mr T. Boone Pickens, Mr James Goldsmith, Mr Saul Steinberg, Mr Boesky and Mr Milken – became fabulously wealthy by engaging in schemes of financial engineering and corporate raids that drove the stock market to dizzying levels before its crash in 1987.Mr Boesky embraced the go-go ethos of the time. “Greed is all right, by the way,” he told business school students at the University of California, Berkeley, in a commencement speech in 1986. “I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself.” He was greeted with rousing applause.A year later, those words were immortalised on screen in Wall Street, in which Gekko (played by actor Michael Douglas), an unscrupulous corporate raider, gives his famous “Greed is good” speech.By 1986, Mr Boesky’s world had begun to unravel. In May, when a lower-level Drexel banker, Dennis Levine, was indicted on insider trading charges, federal prosecutors found Mr Boesky’s name in his notes; he had been paying Levine for tips. Hot on Mr Boesky’s trail was US attorney Rudy Giuliani, who had been bringing down Mafia dons and crooked politicians and was now focused on Wall Street malfeasance.On Sept 17, Mr Boesky surrendered to federal investigators. In an appeal for leniency, agreed to become a government informant, wearing a wire when meeting with Mr Milken, who was an even bigger target of federal prosecutors. A quieter lifeIn December 1987, Mr Boesky was sentenced to a three-year prison term. While in prison, he studied the Talmud and earned pocket change by working on a prison cleanup crew. He later admitted to violating prison rules by paying fellow inmates to do his laundry.He emerged from prison in 1990. He was 53. In 1991, his wife of 30 years sued him for divorce. Pleading poverty, he asked for half of her US$100 million fortune; he settled for US$20 million, annual payments of US$180,000 and a US$2.5 million California home.For many years, Mr Boesky lived quietly in La Jolla, where he remarried and became a father again.In addition to his daughter Marianne, he is survived by three sons from his first marriage, William, Theodore and Johnathan; his wife, Ms Ana (Serrano) Boesky; their daughter, Ms Blu Boesky; and four grandchildren.In a 1985 interview with The Washington Post, Mr Boesky gave a remarkably prescient view of his ultimate downfall. “I can’t predict my demise,” he said. “But I suspect it will occur abruptly.” It did. Within a year, he was arrested and charged with insider trading.

The former Afghan government official also owns a villa there, which he rented out for tens of thousands of dollars every month.Uruguayan drug cartel leader Sebastian Marset, who is wanted by the authorities across South America for drug trafficking, was also identified as a property owner.The leak also revealed that a pair of cryptocurrency scammers, linked to the US$4 billion (S$5.38 billion) OneCoin fraud case, managed to liquidate their Dubai properties even though they were facing criminal charges in the US.As part of the Dubai Unlocked project, ST reported on May 17 that money laundering accused Su Jianfeng had allegedly worked with a Singapore-based businessman to sell properties in Dubai worth tens of millions of dollars to foreigners in Singapore.More on this TopicData leak reveals links between money laundering accused Su Jianfeng and sale of Dubai properties askST: What will happen to assets surrendered in $3b money laundering case?

The official pointed out that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) had taken the UAE off its grey list in February 2024.The FATF, which is the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, places jurisdictions on the grey list if they are working to resolve “strategic deficiencies within agreed timeframes”.These countries are subject to increased monitoring by the watchdog.In response to queries from OCCRP, the UAE Embassy in Oslo said it is committed to safeguarding the integrity of the global financial system.“The UAE takes its role in protecting the integrity of the global financial system extremely seriously,” the embassy said.“In its ongoing hunt of global criminals, the UAE is working closely with international partners to interrupt and prevent all forms of illegal finance.”Mr Hamid Al Zaabi, director-general of the UAE’s Executive Office of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing, was in Singapore in November 2023 with a delegation of Emirati authorities.He told ST in an interview then that he saw it as a positive thing when the UAE was placed on the FATF grey list in 2022, as it led to better processes in the UAE.Mr Al Zaabi’s office has not commented on the Dubai Unlocked project.More on this TopicBusinessmen in S’pore placed on China’s wanted list weeks after money laundering raid in 2023Untangling the complex web behind S’pore’s biggest money laundering caseJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Money launderingUnited Arab EmiratesOrganised crimeFinancial crimesThanks for sharing!"}

According to business records, Su Sihai has been the sole owner and director of the company since 2021.The firm shares the same name as a company in Singapore – Fidu Properties, which is located at One Marina Boulevard.Su Jianfeng went into a business partnership with Su Sihai in 2019, and later helped to incorporate Fidu Properties DMCC in Dubai that same year.They are both board directors, each with 50 per cent ownership in the firm.Su Jianfeng was a wanted man in China at the time. A notice by China’s Ministry of Public Security revealed that he was placed on the wanted list in 2017 for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang.The same notice indicated that in 2015, the authorities were already investigating an online gambling case where Su Jianfeng, Wang Dehai, Su Wenqiang, Su Yongcan and Wang Huoqiang were named as major suspects.They are all connected to the money laundering case in Singapore.Su Wenqiang was convicted on two money laundering charges and deported to Cambodia on May 6, while Wang Dehai’s case is still ongoing.Warrants of arrest and Interpol red notices have been issued against Su Yongcan and Wang Huoqiang for money laundering offences.Despite being a wanted man, Su Jianfeng took part in public events in Dubai.

However, in the videos, he can be seen cutting the ribbon at the opening of an office in 2019, a ceremonial role usually reserved for the guest of honour.The leak suggests that Su Jianfeng may have been the middleman who helped individuals in Singapore, linked to the money laundering case, purchase properties in Dubai, largely between 2020 and 2022.The bulk of the properties were luxury units marketed by Fidu Properties, including The Grand at Dubai Creek and Grande Downtown Dubai.Two previously unknown Singapore-based business figures – Su Shuiming and Su Shuijun – own 11 units each at Grande Downtown that make up the entire 66th and 68th floors of the development.They paid more than $31 million in total for the properties.Su Shuiming and Su Shuijun were placed on China’s wanted list in September 2023 for their involvement in an online gambling syndicate.

They added that her lack of oversight and due diligence as a director later resulted in the three companies being used to receive fraudulent proceeds from foreign scam victims between January and May 2018. The 45-year-old was convicted of three counts of failing to use reasonable diligence in the discharge of her duties as company director. Four other charges of a similar nature were taken into consideration. In addition to the jail term, she was disqualified from being a company director for five years.The police said Tham’s arrangement started sometime in 2016, with her taking on nominee director appointments for companies incorporated by corporate service provider JJ & E Management, a firm in Singapore.The police statement did not indicate the relationship between her and JJ & E Management. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch up on the news that everyone’s talking about\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigations by the Commercial Affairs Department showed she took on roles at the firms she helped incorporate, to fulfil a statutory requirement for Singapore-based companies to have at least one local resident director.

After the companies were incorporated, Tham gave up control of all local bank accounts linked to them. The police said she did not have any access to the companies’ account facilities or bank statements after doing so, with the foreign directors of the companies inheriting control of the accounts. The three companies involved in the charges have been struck off.

The nine banks, whose names were not disclosed, violated mostly procedural rules while collectively shorting 164 stocks, according to a briefing given by the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS). It is continuing to probe five other banks in the matter.Two of the nine banks are already facing penalties imposed by the financial authorities and have been referred to prosecutors for further investigation for allegedly violating the nation’s capital markets law, Mr Hahm Yong-il, senior deputy governor at the FSS, told reporters on May 4. The watchdog plans to review penalties on the other seven banks.Activities of global banks and hedge funds have come under increased scrutiny in recent months in South Korea, as the authorities boost steps to weed out naked short selling – a practice of selling shares without even borrowing them first. While short selling remains legal in many markets, it is a contentious political issue in the emerging Asian nation, with its powerful retail investors often blaming it for stock declines. Describing the practice as “rampant”, the authorities in November imposed a ban on all forms of short selling until the end of June 2024, inviting criticism from some investors that the move will hurt the market’s appeal among global funds. At the same time, a special team was formed to probe all short-selling activities by major global investment banks since May 2021 – when South Korea partially lifted a pandemic-era ban and allowed the resumption of short selling in stocks on the Kospi 200 Index and the Kosdaq 150 Index.Most short-selling trades by global banks in Korea are aimed at hedging their swap contracts with their end-clients, the FSS said.Europe-headquartered banks committed more breaches compared to those based in the United States, and most trades under investigation were conducted from their Hong Kong offices, Mr Hahm said. FSS officials plan to visit Hong Kong later in May to update global banks on Korea’s regulations related to short selling.“So far, most naked short-selling trades by nine banks were related to the management of the stock balance, such as an insufficient number of borrowed shares,” he said.Most of the violations were not related to the use of undisclosed information or other kinds of unfair trading practices that are subject to criminal enforcement.Overall, the 14 banks being probed by the authorities accounted for 90 per cent of short-selling trades by overseas firms in the country, according to the FSS.Regulators are also developing a platform to monitor short selling that can help identify illegal transactions. While the ban imposed in November is slated to remain until the end of June, President Yoon Suk-yeol has recently said restrictions will remain in place until an electronic monitoring system is in place.The probe launch came after the authorities accused in October two global banks of “routinely and intentionally” breaching short-selling rules in trades totalling 56 billion won. In December, BNP Paribas and HSBC Holdings were fined by regulators for claims tied to short selling.In March, HSBC’s Hong Kong unit and three of its traders were indicted by prosecutors. Credit Suisse, which was acquired by UBS Group, is also facing a fine, local Korean media reported in May.

The revisions to the law also precede an upcoming evaluation of China’s anti-money laundering regime by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a leading international watchdog that sets global standards.“In recent years, our anti-money laundering efforts have exposed a number of problems,” China’s central bank governor Pan Gongsheng was reported by state media to have said.Among these are institutions’ inadequate fulfilment of anti-laundering obligations, insufficient information sharing, and “new types of money laundering risks” against which safeguards have “yet to be strengthened”. These are on top of several deficiencies the FATF had flagged when it last evaluated China’s efforts from 2018 to 2019, the reports noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet insights on Asia’s most pressing issues from our regional correspondents\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo plug these gaps, China’s new draft law – which now has 62 articles, up from the previous 37 – spells out institutions’ anti-laundering requirements in greater detail, provides for more scrutiny of their actions, and imposes harsher penalties for non-compliance.It stipulates that financial institutions pay attention to risks stemming from “the use of new technologies and products”, with experts highlighting that virtual assets have become an oft-used tool by money launderers and are a pressing challenge.“Underground banks which use high-tech methods like virtual currencies to move funds have become a priority target for China’s Ministry of Public Security,” Professor Wang Xin of the Peking University Law School told The Straits Times.In 2022, the Chinese police arrested 63 people accused of laundering 12 billion yuan (S$2.3 billion) in criminal proceeds via the cryptocurrency Tether, which is pegged at a 1:1 ratio with the US dollar, despite the trade in cryptocurrencies being illegal in the country. The laundering came to light after the suspects had the cryptocurrency converted to yuan – and the authorities were alerted to high transaction volumes in one of the suspects’ bank accounts.An estimated 20 to 30 per cent of the cases handled by the fintech-focused Mankun Law Firm in Shanghai involves virtual currencies entangled in money laundering-related investigations, said the firm’s director Liu Honglin, who expects a further crackdown by the authorities on this front.Apart from this, the draft law makes clear it is not just financial institutions that have anti-money laundering obligations. They also apply to non-financial entities that deal in assets such as real estate, securities, precious metals and gemstones. This specification would patch loopholes that allow illicit funds to come in through these channels, and address some of the deficiencies identified by the FATF, which is scheduled to commence its next review of China’s anti-money laundering regime in 2025, said Prof Wang.Among other new provisions in the law is one establishing an entity to monitor and analyse high-value and/or suspicious transactions; and another applying China’s laws to money laundering activities that take place abroad but are assessed to infringe on Chinese security and rights.More on this TopicBeijing steps up fight against money laundering even as it tries to stem capital outflow breaches How Chinese networks clean dirty money on a vast scaleExperts that ST spoke to said China’s anti-money laundering efforts have ramped up in recent years.  The number of people prosecuted in China for money laundering offences has increased every year since 2020, from 707 then to 2,971 in 2023, according to figures from the Supreme People’s Procuratorate. And in early 2022, China launched a three-year campaign to fight money laundering, in the name of safeguarding national security.Not all of the laundered funds are generated in China. Some are derived from criminal activities abroad, such as through illegal gambling operations in South-east Asia, the proceeds of which are then channelled back to key stakeholders in China, said Mr Liu, the lawyer.Money laundering is a problem for the Chinese leadership, not least because the illicit flow of funds could feed crimes like terrorism or corruption, but also because the movement of such funds both into and out of the country could sidestep China’s capital controls and potentially affect the stability of its financial system.But even as China steps up its pursuit of dirty money, innocent funds could easily get caught in the crosshairs, said Mr Liu.These include cross-border remittances that, en route to China, come into contact with accounts suspected of moving tainted funds and then get frozen by Chinese authorities investigating money laundering offences. This has been the experience of some Chinese nationals using non-bank third-party services to send money home from Singapore.Mr Liu noted from his clients’ experience that it was difficult to get their funds unfrozen while investigations were ongoing, even if they had provided proof that their source of funds was legitimate.“While we can understand the anti-money laundering requirements, we hope that the implementation of the law does not extend to those whose funds are untainted and can prove their own innocence,” he said.More on this TopicMAS suspends use of non-bank and non-card channels for remittances to ChinaSamlit Moneychanger duo probed for suspected fraudulent trading after money transfers frozen in China\n\n\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.Money launderingChinaFinancial crimesThanks for sharing!"}

The operation was run in the style of a classic Ponzi scheme, where purported returns to clients were paid using the funds from other clients.“Such a business model was clearly unsustainable and... the company finally imploded,” said Deputy Public Prosecutor Hon Yi in earlier proceedings.In the end, the clients received around $12.7 million in total from Aureus Capital and they suffered nearly $6 million in losses.On April 15, Atkins pleaded guilty in a Singapore district court to carrying on a business for a fraudulent purpose.

They were also instructed to transfer cash into a bank account.The bank account received more than $18 million in total from clients between April 2, 2013, and July 15, 2014.Instead of using the monies for forex trading, more than $14.7 million was used for other purposes, such as paying Aureus Capital’s directors, including Atkins. Only around $1.7 million of the more than $18 million was deposited into Oanda, the court heard.Weekly statements sent to clients concealed the fact that only a small portion of clients’ funds was used for forex trading. The statements reported profits which were not reflective of actual trading results. In fact, Aureus Capital was making losses on its Oanda trading accounts.The clients said they were told on June 13, 2014, that Aureus Capital needed to cease trading as it was “acquiring a banking licence”.The clients did not receive any money when they asked for their investments to be withdrawn.

She also bought luxury bags, shoes and high-end cosmetics for herself.On April 24, Jelly Chua Li Li, 40, was sentenced to a total jail term of five years and one month. She had earlier pleaded guilty to three counts of cheating, and two charges of dealing with the benefits of her criminal conduct.Seven other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. Court documents did not reveal the nature of the charges. Chua, 40, was employed by Liberty Insurance between 2011 and 2020. Starting off as a recovery executive, she had risen to a senior claims manager by the time her offences came to light.

The prosecution said that from 2015 to 2020, Chua submitted 131 separate fraudulent insurance claims amounting to $790,793.03 from her company’s payment system, that were paid into her and her husband’s bank accounts. During the same period, Chua transferred $66,869.50 of the proceeds to a bank account in Malaysia. \rThe prosecution said Chua had shown a high level of premeditation and planning for her crimes. \rShe had cheated her firm by either reusing old invoices to support her fraudulent claims, or reopening closed files to create and approve more claims, credited to herself or her husband.For both her methods, Chua made sure to select the Giro payment option as she knew that, under Giro, remitting banks do not check if the payee’s name matches the account holder’s name. Court documents said Chua used primarily her husband’s bank account to avoid detection, as she knew Liberty had details of her bank account. Her act came to light in September 2020, after Chua’s colleague noticed that there were duplicates of payments made to the same law firm that provided services to Liberty.

The prosecution, which sought a sentence of between 68 to 74 months’ jail, said Chua was not truly remorseful as she only stopped when she was caught. The prosecution said Liberty only managed to recover a “meagre” $17,021.21, or less than 3 per cent of the total amount Chua had cheated her firm out of.

Terraform’s UST, an algorithmic stablecoin that was supposed to be pegged to the price of the US dollar, wiped out US$40 billion in market value when it collapsed in 2022. The court should send “an unequivocal message that this sort of brazen misconduct” will not be tolerated, the SEC said in the filing. The proposed fine comprised a US$4.2 billion disgorgement penalty and US$545 million in pre-judgment interest, as well as US$420 million and US$100 million civil penalties for Terraform and Kwon, respectively. All told, the fine would surpass the US$4.3 billion paid by Binance to settle anti-money laundering and US sanctions violations charges with the US Department of Justice in November 2023, itself one of the largest corporate agreements in US history. Lawyers representing Kwon and Terraform challenged the SEC’s claims, arguing that token sales took place outside the US and did not violate federal securities law. Kwon was arrested in Montenegro a year ago and convicted of attempting to travel using a fake passport. He is currently awaiting extradition either to the US or his native South Korea and faces criminal fraud charges in both countries. The SEC also asked the court for a permanent bar on Kwon, who owns 92 per cent of Terraform, serving as an officer or director and seeks a “sworn accounting” of his assets.

In March 2023, he was extradited from the US to Singapore.Deputy Public Prosecutor Hon Yi told the court that Atkins, a majority shareholder of the firm, had full control of the scheme which used only a fraction of the clients’ monies for forex trading.He said: “The scheme was run in the style of a classic ‘Ponzi’, where purported returns to clients were paid using the funds from other clients... Such a business model was clearly unsustainable and... the company finally imploded.”In the end, the clients received around $12.7 million in total from Aureus Capital and they suffered nearly $6 million in losses.DPP Hon urged the court to sentence Atkins to up to three years and eight months’ jail, adding: “In effect, the scheme was his and all losses caused to the clients of Aureus must be directly attributable to him only.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch up on the news that everyone’s talking about\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween April 2013 and July 2014, Aureus Capital offered leveraged foreign exchange trading services and schemes.Clients entered into agreements allowing Aureus Capital to engage in forex trading on their behalf. Under these agreements, the company would be entitled to 40 to 50 per cent of the profits generated from the trading, while the losses from trading would be fully borne by the clients.At the time of the offence, Aureus Capital maintained two trading accounts with Oanda Asia Pacific, a separate company which offers foreign exchange trading. Clients were told Aureus Capital would manage their funds by trading forex on Oanda, said DPP Hon. They were instructed to transfer cash into a bank account. The bank account received more than $18 million in total from clients between April 2, 2013, and July 15, 2014. Instead of using it for forex trading, more than $14.7 million was used for other purposes, such as paying Aureus Capital’s directors, including Atkins.Only around $1.7 million of the more than $18 million was deposited into Oanda, the court heard. Weekly statements sent to clients concealed the fact that only a small portion of clients’ funds was used for forex trading. Weekly statements reported profits which were not reflective of actual trading results. In fact, Aureus Capital was making losses on its Oanda trading accounts.The clients said they were told on June 13, 2014, that Aureus Capital needed to cease trading as it was acquiring a banking licence. The clients did not receive any money when they asked for their investments to be withdrawn.E-mails from the firm claimed it was being rebranded and all clients’ monies would be refunded by July 28, 2014. Clients alerted the police when the company and its directors became uncontactable. Atkins was arrested. An Interpol red notice was issued against him after he jumped bail. Such a notice requests law enforcement units worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender or other legal actions.He was traced in the US in 2017 and an extradition request was sent to the authorities there three years later.He was successfully extradited to Singapore and re-arrested here on March 18, 2023.Atkins will be sentenced on April 25.More on this TopicMan who left S’pore 9 years ago charged over alleged involvement in fraudulent investment schemeMan to be charged over GST fraud involving fake sale of items amounting to over $250m\n\n\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Singapore courtsCrimeFinancial crimesThanks for sharing!"}

REUTERS/Mohamed AzakirUPDATED Apr 04, 2024, 08:37 PMThanks for sharing!BEIRUT/PARIS - Two anti-graft groups have filed a complaint in France against Lebanon's billionaire caretaker premier Najib Mikati and his relatives, seeking an investigation into alleged financial crimes including money laundering, according to a document seen by Reuters.In a statement issued by his office, Mikati said he had not been formally notified of the complaint and that his family's wealth was acquired transparently and legally. It said the accusations were part of a \"media campaign\" aimed at \"insulting him and his family members\". Forbes lists Mikati and his brother Taha as Lebanon's two richest men, tied for the top with $2.8 billion net worth each.     The complaint, dated April 2, was lodged at the National Financial Prosecutor's office in France by anti-corruption groups Sherpa and the Collective of Victims of Fraudulent and Criminal Practices in Lebanon.The National Financial Prosecutor's office in France said it could not immediately confirm receipt of the complaint, and declined further comment. The complaint lays out an array of companies and real estate owned by Mikati and relatives in France, or registered in other countries, saying they warrant further inquiry to establish alleged acts of money laundering and receiving stolen goods.\"That's the kind of mechanical consequences of being a billionaire politician - you consider your position to be a kind of shelter against prosecution,\" William Bourdon, a lawyer for Sherpa, told Reuters on Thursday.Bourdon said he expected an investigation to be opened, and that it would also establish links between Mikati and Lebanon's former central bank governor Riad Salameh, whose 30-year legacy at the Banque du Liban (BdL) ended last year in tatters. France and Germany have issued arrest warrants for Salameh as part of their investigations into him and his brother Raja for allegedly taking hundreds of millions of dollars from Lebanon's central bank, to the detriment of the Lebanese state, and laundering the funds abroad.The Salameh brothers have denied any kind of wrongdoing.\"The complaint particularly draws the attention of the authorities to the financial transfers between the former prime minister, his relatives and the (Central) Bank of Lebanon,\" a press release by Sherpa on Thursday said.

PHOTO: REUTERSUPDATED Mar 29, 2024, 05:00 PMThanks for sharing!The sentencing of cryptocurrency wunderkind-turned-convicted-fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried to 25 years in jail, along with the forfeiture of more than US$11 billion (S$14.8 billion), looks like a fair outcome. While not as harsh as the request from prosecutors for as many as 50 years, it should stand as a clear deterrent for aspiring fraudsters both in traditional finance and its decentralised offshoots. And given crypto is still in the midst of a much-needed clean-up, that matters.To recap, the 32-year-old Bankman-Fried was convicted of fraud, conspiracy and several other offences in 2023 after the spectacular collapse of his crypto exchange FTX revealed a US$8 billion hole of missing customer funds under his watch. The jury was not swayed by the one-time billionaire’s defence that he had fallen victim to a market downturn, largely because the evidence was so overwhelming and his defence so contradictory. His former lieutenants’ testimony was as damning as his own lack of remorse and history of statements like: “F**k regulators”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Already a subscriber? Log in\n\n\n\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\n\nGet Digital Access\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Digital Access\n\n\n\nMonthly Savings\n\n$9.90\n$5/month\n\n\n\nSubscribe today!\n\n\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\n\n\n\nMonthly Recurring\n\n\n$9.90/month\n\n\n\nSubscribe now\n\n\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\n\n\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.CryptocurrenciesCourt trialsFinancial crimesThanks for sharing!"}

A jury found Bankman-Fried, 32, guilty on Nov 2, 2023, on seven fraud and conspiracy counts stemming from FTX’s 2022 collapse in what prosecutors have called one of the biggest financial frauds in US history.Judge Kaplan said Bankman-Fried has shown no remorse.“He knew it was wrong,” the judge said. “He knew it was criminal. He regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood of getting caught. But he is not going to admit a thing, as is his right.”Bankman-Fried, wearing a beige short-sleeved jail T-shirt, acknowledged during 20 minutes of remarks to the judge that FTX customers had suffered, and he offered an apology to his former FTX colleagues – but did not admit criminal wrongdoing.He has vowed to appeal against his conviction and sentence.He stood with his hands clasped before him as the judge read the sentence. He then spoke with his defence lawyer Marc Mukasey briefly before being led out of the courtroom by members of the United States Marshals Service.The sentence marked the culmination of Bankman-Fried’s plunge from being an ultra-wealthy entrepreneur and major political donor to the biggest trophy to date in a crackdown by the US authorities on malfeasance in cryptocurrency markets.“There are serious consequences for defrauding customers and investors,” US Attorney-General Merrick Garland said in a statement. “Anyone who believes they can hide their financial crimes behind wealth and power, or behind a shiny new thing they claim no one else is smart enough to understand, should think twice.”Judge Kaplan found that FTX customers lost US$8 billion, FTX’s equity investors lost US$1.7 billion, and lenders to the Alameda Research hedge fund Bankman-Fried founded lost US$1.3 billion. The judge imposed a US$11 billion forfeiture order and authorised the government to repay victims with seized assets.Federal prosecutors had sought a sentence of 40 to 50 years. Mr Mukasey had argued for a sentence of less than 5¼ years.‘I’m sorry for that’Addressing the judge, Bankman-Fried said: “Customers have been suffering... I didn’t at all mean to minimise that. I also think that’s something that was missing from what I’ve said over the course of this process, and I’m sorry for that.”Referring to his FTX colleagues, Bankman-Fried added: “They put a lot of themselves into it, and I threw that all away. It haunts me every day.”Three former close associates testified as prosecution witnesses that Bankman-Fried had directed them to use FTX customer funds to plug losses at Alameda Research. All three have pleaded guilty to fraud.\rMore on this TopicThe crypto fraud case against Sam Bankman-Fried and FTXSam Bankman-Fried will not face a second trial on remaining chargesThe judge said Bankman-Fried lied when he testified that he did not know Alameda Research had spent customer deposits taken from FTX.Mr Mukasey sought to distance his client from notorious fraudsters like Bernie Madoff, saying he was “not a ruthless financial serial killer” but rather an “awkward math nerd” who tried to get customers their money back after FTX’s collapse.“Sam Bankman-Fried doesn’t make decisions with malice in his heart,” the lawyer added. “He makes decisions with math in his head.”Bankman-Fried’s eyes turned red as he appeared to hold back tears while Mr Mukasey spoke.His parents, Stanford University law professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, attended the sentencing. Mr Bankman held a green umbrella as he and Ms Fried exited the courthouse into a rainy New York afternoon, their arms around each other.“We are heartbroken and will continue to fight for our son,” they said in a statement.‘Power and influence’A Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate, Bankman-Fried rode a boom in the values of Bitcoin and other digital assets to a net worth of US$26 billion, according to Forbes magazine, before he turned 30. He became known for his mop of unkempt, curly hair and commitment to a movement called effective altruism, which encourages talented young people to focus on earning money and giving it away to worthy causes.He was one of the biggest contributors to Democratic candidates and causes before the 2022 US midterm elections. Judge Kaplan pointed to trial evidence showing Bankman-Fried also donated to Republicans through “straw” donors to hide his involvement.The judge called Bankman-Fried’s efforts to present himself as a “good guy” an act, adding: “The goal was power and influence.”Bankman-Fried has been detained at the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn since August 2023, when Judge Kaplan revoked his bail after finding he most likely tampered with witnesses at least twice. The judge said he would recommend that he be sent to a prison close to San Francisco.

Many residents of Africa’s most populous nation have flocked to crypto assets amid a plunge in the nation’s currency. That prompted the authorities to crack down on platforms offering digital tokens. Central bank governor Olayemi Cardoso in February alleged that Binance handled US$26 billion (S$35 billion) in untraceable transactions, days before the two Binance executives visiting Nigeria were detained.Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, held in the West African country since late February, were identified as defendants in the case filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja, the nation’s capital, Firs said.Anjarwalla, who holds British and Kenyan citizenships, escaped from custody on March 22, the National Security Adviser said in a separate statement on March 25. The executive was on a 14-day detention and scheduled to appear in court on April 4. Binance has been “made aware that Nadeem is no longer in Nigerian custody”, a spokesperson said in response to queries. While the crackdown has hobbled Binance in Nigeria, other crypto exchanges,  including Yellow Card Financial, are still operational.“There is quite a drastic drop in the trade volumes and trading activities on those platforms,” said Mr Obinna Iwuno, president of an association of blockchain stakeholders in Nigeria. Nigeria risks missing an “opportunity to capture the massive global value from the fastest-growing emerging technology in the world”, he said.The Binance executives had been invited to Nigeria to meet officials in February after the government blocked access to cryptocurrency channels amid a crackdown on currency speculators. The country has witnessed a 70 per cent devaluation in the value of the naira against the US dollar since foreign exchange reforms in 2023, exacerbated by local dollar scarcity.

ST PHOTO: KELVIN CHNGAndrew WongUPDATED Mar 16, 2024, 07:21 AMThanks for sharing!SINGAPORE - Over a period of three years, an accounting manager conspired with a  colleague to cheat her employer, a custom carpentry firm, of $317,710 in total. Chiang Lai Fah, 37, who was entrusted by Kai Millwork to approve payments to freelancers, did so for false invoices and kept a part of the money. She even lied to a couple – her friends – to gain access to their bank accounts, which she used to move more than $171,000. On March 15, Chiang pleaded guilty to one charge of cheating and one charge of conspiring to cheat, and was sentenced to 10 months’ jail. Three other charges, amounting to $145,720, were taken into consideration during sentencing. \rThe court heard that in 2021, Chiang’s colleague Teoh Chwin Tzen, referred to as Jason in court documents, approached Chiang to propose a scheme whereby they could cheat the company.

This is because employees of the firm are not entitled to any commission. Chiang was to sign off on the invoices for payment, and the “freelancers” would then transfer the money to Jason allegedly. Chiang agreed, after she was promised a cut of the proceeds for her help. Sometime in 2022, Chiang approached her friend to ask if she could use her friend’s husband’s bank account. She lied to them, saying the bank account would be used to receive the salary of a foreign worker who did not have his own account. The couple was supposed to inform Chiang after receiving the “salary”, and she would inform them to transfer the money to her own account. Chiang would then pass the money to Jason, the court heard. Between January 2022 and December 2022, Chiang approved falsified invoices using the name of her friend’s husband and sent payments amounting to $171,990 to his bank account on 15 occasions. Deputy Public Prosecutor Nicole Teo, who sought a jail term of between 10 months and a year, said that Chiang retained more than $82,000 from the scheme.\rShe has since made full restitution to the firm. \rChiang’s actions came to light after Jason was investigated for offences related to the company. The Straits Times understands that Jason’s case is still pending.

The man, who acted as their insurance agent, spent it on online gambling and on himself.On March 13, Tan Wei Chong, 36, was sentenced to two years and six months’ jail after pleading guilty to two charges of criminal breach of trust, one charge of cheating and one charge of forgery. Five other charges involving $39,820 were taken into consideration.The victims were his friend’s mother and sister, known as the first and second victim in court. The friend had introduced Tan, who was working as a financial consultant at The Great Eastern Life Assurance Company at the time, to his family to act as their family insurance agent.

After some discussion, the 71-year-old agreed to invest a sum of $100,000. She asked the second victim, her daughter, to help her issue a cheque of $100,000. Her daughter, 38, left the payee’s name unwritten according to Tan’s instructions. Upon receiving the cheque, Tan wrote his father’s company as the payee and deposited the cheque. Tan had the Internet banking credentials and token for the company’s bank account as he was assisting his father with the finances of the company. The prosecution said Tan’s father was unaware of his son’s activities. \rTan then transferred the $100,000 in multiple smaller transactions to his own bank account. On Oct 16, 2019, Tan called his friend’s mother again with a new proposal for another insurance policy.  The court heard that Tan had fabricated the policy, which was never offered by Great Eastern. The mother instructed her daughter to issue another cheque for $120,000 to Tan. Again, he instructed them to leave the payee’s name unwritten. \rHe deposited the cheque into his father’s company’s account on the same day.

She agreed and instructed her daughter to issue a cheque for $30,000 with the payee’s name unwritten. He then withdrew the entire $150,000 without his father’s knowledge, and spent the money on himself. \rOn Sept 9, 2020, the first victim called Tan to inform that she had not received any payout from Great Eastern even though her policy should have matured. \rTan told her there were delays in processing payment, and later forged a letter from Great Eastern to back up his lie. In March 2020, Tan called his friend’s mother again to say he had difficulties hitting his sales target. She agreed to help him by purchasing a single-premium policy for $20,000. He then instructed her to transfer the money to his personal bank account.  The prosecution said Tan had no intention of buying any policies for the first victim, and had wanted to spend the money on himself. \rThe fraud came to light after a compliance officer at Great Eastern received information that Tan had sold a fictitious policy to the first victim. The officer then lodged a police report. Great Eastern has since reimbursed the victims. Deputy Public Prosecutor Cheng You Duen said Tan had not come up with a single cent to pay back the victims.

PHOTO: REUTERSSue-Ann TanUPDATED Mar 08, 2024, 12:04 AMThanks for sharing!SINGAPORE – The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will have wider investigative and supervisory powers over the financial industry, with a new Bill passed in Parliament on March 7. These include the ability to enter premises without a warrant and without first issuing orders to a suspect, to issue legally binding directions to holders of capital markets services licences, and to approve appointments of key people in more types of financial institutions.Minister of State for Trade and Industry Alvin Tan said in his reading of the Bill that the changes will enhance MAS’ ability to enforce its regulatory regime and more effectively supervise capital markets financial institutions. “This will further strengthen Singapore’s position as a safe and trusted international financial centre,” he said.“As our financial industry grows in size and complexity, MAS must continually review and enhance its regulatory powers to ensure that it can effectively supervise financial institutions, as well as investigate and punish serious misconduct in our financial sector,” he added.One of the amendments is aimed at strengthening the MAS’ capabilities in gathering evidence. It will give the authority more power to require people to appear before an MAS officer for examination and statement recording for investigation purposes.It will also mean that MAS can enter premises without a warrant, without first issuing orders to a suspect to produce information. Before the amendments, under two Acts, MAS officers had to first issue orders and show that a suspect has failed to comply, before they could enter premises. This power to enter premises without a warrant has now been extended to some other MAS-administered Acts as well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch up on the news that everyone’s talking about\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n“This will enable MAS to enter premises without tipping off the suspect, and therefore reduce the risk of the suspect destroying evidence related to the investigation,” Mr Tan said.In addition, the Bill will expand provisions that allow for the transfer of evidence between MAS, the police and other law enforcement agencies.MAS will also have more power in capital markets, with the ability to issue directions to holders of capital markets services licences over their unregulated businesses. Currently, holders of such licences can conduct unregulated business, such as dealing in products not regulated by MAS, like digital payment token derivatives that are traded on overseas exchanges. “These unregulated businesses may pose contagion risks to capital markets services licence holders’ regulated businesses. For instance, losses from a licence holder’s unregulated business could adversely impact its ability to meet its obligations to customers in its regulated business,” Mr Tan said. “Customers may also not be fully aware that regulatory protections do not apply to the licence holder’s unregulated businesses.”While MAS has issued guidance to such licence holders on having measures to mitigate risks and safeguards they should adopt, the Bill will empower the authority to issue legally binding directions to them, he added.MAS will also have power over approving appointments of key people in locally incorporated, recognised market operators, recognised clearing houses and approved trustees – companies that the current legislation does not cover.Finally, MAS will also require companies like approved exchanges, clearing houses, holding companies and licensed trade repositories to get approval when they appoint external auditors on an annual basis.Mr Tan said it is important that the auditors appointed by these companies can satisfactorily perform their duties, given the central role such companies play in capital markets.“With these amendments, MAS will align the approach for capital markets financial institutions with the approach that MAS has taken for other systemically important financial institutions under its purview, such as banks and insurance companies,” Mr Tan said.He also addressed concerns that some MPs brought up. Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) asked what kind of guidance enforcement officers will receive to exercise their expanded investigative powers.Mr Tan said: “MAS has internal processes and guidance which (take) into account police procedures and practices to ensure that MAS officers exercise investigative powers lawfully and judiciously.”He added: “MAS recognises that the ability to enter premises is a significant power. However, this power is necessary to enable MAS to effectively investigate potential breaches under the MAS-administered Acts.”More on this TopicMAS records highest civil penalties for financial crimes in latest enforcement reportMAS speeds up probe of financial crimes, gives updates on key cases\n\n\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Singapore ParliamentMAS/Monetary Authority of SingaporeFinancial crimesThanks for sharing!"}

People who respond are then lured into fake crypto investments.PHOTO: ST FILEUPDATED Mar 01, 2024, 08:16 PMThanks for sharing!New York - “Pig-butchering” scammers have likely stolen more than US$75 billion (S$101 billion) from victims around the world, far more than previously estimated, according to a new study.Dr John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas at Austin, and graduate student Kevin Mei gathered crypto addresses from more than 4,000 victims of the fraud, which has exploded in popularity since the pandemic. They tracked the flow of funds from victims to scammers largely based in South-east Asia. Over four years, from January 2020 to February 2024, the criminal networks moved more than US$75 billion to crypto exchanges, said Dr Griffin, who has written about fraud in financial markets. Some of the total could represent proceeds from other criminal activities, he said. “These are large criminal organised networks and they’re operating largely unscathed.” Pig butchering – a scam named after the practice of farmers fattening hogs before slaughter – often starts with what appears to be a wrong-number text message. People who respond are lured into crypto investments. But the investments are fake and once victims send enough funds, the scammers disappear. As far-fetched as it sounds, victims routinely lose hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. One Kansas banker was charged in February with embezzling US$47.1 million from his bank as part of a pig-butchering scam. The people sending the messages are often themselves victims of human trafficking from across South-east Asia. They are lured to compounds in countries, including Cambodia and Myanmar, with offers of high-paying jobs, then trapped, forced to scam, and sometimes beaten and tortured. The United Nations has estimated that more than 200,000 people are being held in scam compounds.The study – titled How Do Crypto Flows Finance Slavery? The Economics Of Pig Butchering – was released on Feb 29. Dr Griffin and Mr Mei found that US$15 billion had come from five exchanges, including Coinbase, typically used by victims in Western countries. The study said that once the scammers collected the funds, they most often converted them into Tether, a popular stablecoin. Of the addresses touched by the criminals, 84 per cent of the transaction volume was in Tether.“In the old days, it would be extremely difficult to move that much cash through the financial system,” Dr Griffin said. “You’d have to go through banks and follow ‘know-your-customer’ procedures. Or you’d have to put cash in bags.”Tether chief executive officer Paolo Ardoino called the report false and misleading. “With Tether, every action is online, every action is traceable, every asset can be seized and every criminal can be caught,” he said in a statement. “We work with law enforcement to do exactly that.”Tether has cooperated with the authorities in some cases to freeze accounts tied to fraud. But often, by the time the crime is reported, the scammers have cashed out.Dr Griffin said the study shows Tether is “the currency of choice for criminal networks”.Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis firm, said the study’s totals might be inflated. Just because a blockchain address receives some money from a pig-butchering scam does not mean all the money received by that address comes from fraud. “Quantifying funds earned through pig-butchering scams is challenging, given limited reporting,” said Chainalysis spokeswoman Maddie Kennedy. Tether is one of the company’s customers.  Many of the fraud victims’ blockchain addresses were collected by Chainbrium, a Norwegian crypto investigations firm. Chainbrium conducted its own analysis of the data and found that a large proportion of the funds flowed through a purportedly decentralised crypto exchange called Tokenlon. Scammers use the exchange to obscure the source of the funds, according to Chainbrium. Tokenlon did not respond to a request for comment. “People in the United States... their money is going straight to South-east Asia into this underground economy,” said Chainbrium consultant Jan Santiago.Eventually, the criminals would send the scam proceeds to centralised crypto exchanges to cash out for traditional money. Dr Griffin said Binance is the most popular exchange, even after the company and its founder Zhao Changpeng pleaded guilty in November to criminal anti-money laundering and sanctions charges and agreed to pay US$4.3 billion to resolve a long-running investigation by prosecutors and regulators.“Binance is the place where they can move large amounts of money out of the system,” Dr Griffin said.Like Tether, Binance has worked with law enforcement in some cases to freeze accounts tied to fraud and return money to victims. A company spokesman said it recently worked with the authorities to seize US$112 million in a pig-butchering case.

The combination of the changes, pushed through by Prime Minister Robert Fico's coalition in a fast-track legislative procedure, has alarmed the opposition as well as the European Commission and the European Prosecutor's Office.Criticism has focused on the lack of wide debate, a marked lowering of punishments for financial crimes, and a shortening of statutes of limitations which would forever halt many ongoing investigations, even if the law took effect for just one day.President Zuzana Caputova described the Constitutional Court's decision as \"good news for democracy and rule of law\". \"The system of checks and balances worked, that is the most important message to all Slovak citizens...is also a needed message to our foreign partners, that the money of European taxpayers remains adequately protected,\" she said.The court did not scrap plans to abolish the Office of Special Prosecutor, which has dealt with high-level crime including cases involving senior public officials and politicians from Fico's SMER-SD party.Fico said he was generally satisfied that the special prosecutors office would cease to exist, after he repeatedly accused it of being politically biased against him and his party.  \"For me the most important thing was achieved - shutting down the prosecutor's office,\" he told a televised news conference. \"I was myself a victim of bullying by the USP.\"Caputova had argued that doing away with the USP would delay about 1,000 pending court cases which would have be shunted to other prosecution branches.  Thursday's top court decision means the affected parts of the reform will not take effect on March 15, pending further deliberations by the court that may take months.The court acted speedily, aiming to make its decision effective before the reform law went into force.

His Acra records had no details about DM Advisory, Temco Industrial and Integrated Invest.Five Singaporean men linked to the case were dealt with in court earlier.

Details about Clarke’s identity were not disclosed in court documents.Even though the pair had never met, Tan agreed to help Clarke incorporate several firms here. Deputy Public Prosecutor Yeo Zhen Xiong told the court that Tan and Phua, also known as Roy, had a business relationship.In November 2016, the pair entered into an arrangement for Phua to recruit local nominee directors for Tan’s foreign clients, such as Clarke. This was done to fulfil a regulatory requirement of having at least one director in the firm who is a Singapore resident.As part of the arrangement, Tan would give Phua between $6,000 and $8,000 for each local nominee director. In March 2017, Phua introduced Low and Wong Zhang Jie to Tan.Tan later told Phua and Low  that Clarke needed help to incorporate Temco Industrial and set up bank accounts for it on behalf of one “Mark Lawrence”. The company was formed soon after.In June and August 2017, representatives from two different firms lodged police reports after their companies were duped into transferring nearly US$690,000 to Temco’s bank account.More on this TopicJail for ex-director whose companies' bank accounts received ill-gotten gains of over $3.4mS’pore company, director allegedly involved in possessing over $2.2m in criminal proceedsScammers linked to these cases had impersonated actual business partners of these two companies.DPP Yeo said that the scammers had sent e-mails from accounts which were designed to look very similar to those belonging to the pair.Through e-mail, the scammers then cheated the two firms into transferring cash to Temco’s bank account.The prosecutor said that out of the about US$690,000, only around US$7,200 was recovered. From this amount, one of the companies received about $200 while the other received more than $7,000.As for the case involving Integrated Invest, the court heard that some time in 2017, Clarke asked for Tan’s help to incorporate the firm on behalf of one “Edward Hopkins”.Phua then approached Wong Zhang Jie, who agreed to be Integrated Invest’s nominee director.In July 2017, Singapore’s Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) received a complaint from a customer service specialist of a firm stating that her company had been fraudulently induced to transfer more than US$44,000 to Integrated Invest’s bank account.CAD later seized the account and obtained a court order to return the full amount to the woman’s employer in August 2019.Tan’s bail was set at $100,000 on Feb 23, and he was ordered to surrender himself at the State Courts on March 11 to begin serving his sentence.More on this TopicNominee director fined after firm’s bank account was used to receive $620k in scam proceeds S’poreans who helped set up firms linked to $2.8b money laundering case removing their names\n\n\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Singapore courtsCrimeFinancial crimesThanks for sharing!"}

Thus, the wholly-owned subsidiary of mainboard-listed Chuan Hup would have to refund this amount.This could pave the way for the liquidators to pursue legal proceedings against other investors who have withdrawn profits from their investments with Envy Asset Management.\rWhen asked about the value or percentage of similar purported profits that have been clawed back from investors, the liquidators from KPMG were unable to comment due to confidentiality reasons.According to the judgment released on Feb 21, Envy Asset Management purported to purchase quantities of London Metal Exchange (LME) Nickel Grade Metal from Australian company Poseidon Nickel from January 2016 to around April 2020.The purchases were purported to be made at a 16 per cent to 25 per cent discount to the average of the LME Nickel official daily cash settlement prices for the month prior to the month of scheduled shipment. Envy Asset Management would then purport to sell the metal at a higher price to third-party buyers for a profit.Investors would pay a principal amount to buy into one of the purported nickel trades of Envy Asset Management, with the prospect of earning a percentage of their principal amount and the profit made from the metal trading.\rEnvy Asset Management guaranteed that investors would get back approximately 85 per cent of their principal amount upon maturity of their investments. But the interim judicial managers of Envy Asset Management found that the purported nickel trading was non-existent, and that the documents that had been presented as proof of trading activity were forged.Investors’ funds that had been invested with Envy Asset Management and another company in the group, Envy Global Trading, had instead gone to shareholder Ng Yu Zhi as well as paid as director fees to him and another individual. Some of these funds were also paid to employees as remuneration, as well as to investors as referral fees or fictitious profits.All these payments were made without any proper or legitimate basis because the purported nickel trading was non-existent. The Envy companies did not engage in any other meaningful business either, the liquidators found.\rCH Biovest invested $5.5 million with Envy Asset Management for eight months to February 2020 and received $7.8 million in return, making a profit of $2.3 million.CH Biovest said it is a bona fide investor who had believed that Envy Asset Management was conducting a legitimate business. The impression was reinforced when Envy Asset Management performed the know-your-client checks, prompting CH Biovest to believe that it was a safe and trustworthy investment environment.\rBut Justice Goh Yihan noted that Envy Asset Management had perpetrated fraud. There was no investment to speak of and thus the purported nickel held by it could not have appreciated in value.\rHe said: “There was actual fraud because a Ponzi scheme operator must know that the scheme will eventually collapse, and there is no legitimate purpose in the operation of the scheme other than to defraud investors.”\rDavid Chan of Shook Lin & Bok represented the liquidators while Aldgate Chambers acted for CH Biovest.

The firm said the move would “enable it to continue its operations and support for the Terra community and ecosystem”. It added that the filing would let it execute its business plan while navigating ongoing legal proceedings, including representative litigation pending in Singapore and in the US, which involves the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Terraform Labs said it intended to meet all financial obligations to employees and vendors during the Chapter 11 case, and did not require additional financing to do so. Reports said the firm had listed assets and liabilities in the range of US$100 million to US$500 million. Mr Chris Amani, chief executive of Terraform Labs, said: “The Terra community and ecosystem have shown unprecedented resilience in the face of adversity, and this action is necessary to allow us to continue working towards our collective goals while resolving the legal challenges that remain outstanding.” He added that the decision ensured it is able to continue working with the community on infrastructure, innovative tools and products, and other ecosystem support. “We have overcome significant challenges before and, against long odds, the ecosystem survived and even grew in new ways post-depeg. We look forward to the successful resolution of the outstanding legal proceedings,” Mr Amani said.The SEC has launched a civil trial against Terraform Labs and Kwon for allegedly orchestrating a US$40 billion cryptocurrency fraud via his algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and sister token Luna.A stablecoin is a digital token that usually has a valuation of US$1 and is pegged to or backed by fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies or commodities on a one-to-one basis.In the case of TerraUSD, the stablecoin was backed by Luna, with both tied to the Terra blockchain.TerraUSD used algorithms and trader incentives linked to Luna to maintain the dollar peg, but both tokens crashed spectacularly in May 2022, wiping out more than US$40 billion of investors’ monies.The SEC alleges that from April 2018 until the scheme’s collapse in May 2022, Terraform Labs and Kwon raised billions of dollars from investors by offering and selling an interconnected suite of crypto asset securities, many in unregistered transactions. The crash of TerraUSD and Luna triggered the fall of many crypto firms, including prominent ones such as hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, Singapore lender Hodlnaut, brokerage Voyager Digital and lender Celsius Network. The collapse of TerraUSD and Luna eventually sparked a massive crypto winter or market sell-off that lasted for much of 2023. Kwon, a South Korean national, also faces related US criminal charges over fraud and market manipulation. He was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023. There is also an extradition request from his native South Korea.More on this TopicUS SEC willing to delay Terraform Labs trial for Do Kwon's extraditionClass action with 377 parties against Terraform, Do Kwon to move ahead in Singapore court Join ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.CryptocurrenciesFinancial crimesBlockchainThanks for sharing!"}

Caputova told parliament it was \"unprecedented\" to make such changes in a fast-track legislative procedure.\"The absence of proper expert debate multiplies the risks connected with this amendment, because there is a lack of analysis of its all practical and technical consequences,\" she said.Fico has argued that Slovak sentences were too harsh compared with many European countries, and has accused the USP of bias against his party.But Caputova pointed out that the European prosecutors office has raised concern the planned changes may lead to insufficient punishment for abuse of European Union funds.She also said the proposed reduction in sentences would go beyond that in neighbouring states. Caputova offered an example that a burglary, which caused damage of up to 350,000 euros, might only be punished by suspended sentence, as many other serious crimes, including money laundering.Shortening statutes of limitations would at once end liability for thousands of already committed crimes, she also warned. \"The four-way combination of the fundamental lowering of sentences, higher damage thresholds, changes to conditions of suspended sentences and changes in statutes of limitations would be resignation of the state on protecting its citizens,\" Caputova said.'CORRECT' STEPIn response, Fico said the government stood firm behind the proposals, arguing they would right some wrongs and modernise criminal law.  \"These are steps we consider fundamentally correct,\" he told a briefing.The European Commission and the United States have already raised objections to Fico's plans. The European Parliament on Wednesday called for more scrutiny of the changes and the  for European Commission to take action \"to safeguard the rule of law and judicial independence\".The special prosecutors opened a number of cases against business leaders, members of the judiciary and police, following a 2020 election win by parties promising to fight graft.While in opposition, Fico himself had faced police charges, later dropped, that he used information from police and tax authorities to discredit political rivals.

The company remains “committed” to working with regulators to provide services in the Middle East and beyond, the spokesperson added.Mr Teng has indicated that he plans to adopt a conventional corporate structure for the world’s largest crypto exchange, including naming a headquarters and board of directors, as well as providing greater financial transparency. Binance on Nov 21 pleaded guilty to US anti-money laundering and sanctions violations, incurring a US$4.3 billion (S$5.8 billion) fine as well as ongoing oversight from the authorities there. Founder Zhao Changpeng also pleaded guilty and stepped down as CEO, handing arguably the toughest job in crypto to Mr Teng.A US judge on Dec 7 ruled that Zhao cannot return to his home in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) before he is sentenced. US District Judge Richard Jones rejected the billionaire’s request to return to the UAE following his guilty plea in November. Zhao, who stepped down as CEO as part of the plea deal, theoretically faces as much as 10 years in prison but is expected to get no more than 18 months. He also agreed to pay a US$50 million fine.Binance was already adjusting its footprint ahead of the US settlement as it fielded a web of probes in key jurisdictions. The company said it exited Russia, Canada and the Netherlands, and wound down its derivatives exchange in Australia. Binance.US lost banking support and saw trading volumes contract.While Binance globally remains the biggest platform for buying and selling digital assets as well as crypto derivatives, its dominance is waning. The exchange’s share of spot trading volumes slid to 32 per cent in November from 55 per cent at the start of 2023, according to CCData. Its derivatives market share declined to 48 per cent from more than 60 per cent.Mr Teng is a civil servant turned crypto executive whose resume includes a stint as CEO of the regulator at Abu Dhabi’s international financial free zone.

The bottom line, served alongside an haute, Binance-hosted private dinner in a bustling nightlife district was: The largest crypto exchange in the world would survive its American legal troubles.That evening, a few dozen or so market makers dubbed VIPs entered a dining room at the posh members-only club called 1880. \rNotably absent from the scene was Zhao Changpeng, the firm’s public face who would just two months later plead guilty to a criminal charge in a Seattle courtroom and step down. However, Mr Richard Teng, Zhao’s replacement-to-be, was there mingling with the guests, according to several attendees, who asked not to be identified discussing the private gathering.As the dinner wore on, the party broke off into smaller groups. Binance officials were asked directly about details on the company’s legal woes. \rThe assembled traders pressed Binance officials on how much the firm would pay the US Justice Department and the other American authorities to settle, including raising the likelihood of a US$4 billion (S$5.3 billion) penalty. After conversations with company representatives present at the dinner, some VIP guests were left convinced that the firm would pay that sum – an amount Binance could easily afford.A Binance spokesman said the depiction of the event was inaccurate, while declining to identify which aspects were wrong.Dubai towerAfter years of jet-setting, Zhao had stuck closer to his adopted home of the United Arab Emirates in 2023. His sprawling downtown Dubai apartment is next to the Burj Khalifa, which is the world’s tallest building. Zhao and Ms Yi He, Binance’s co-founder with whom he has children, did not even show up in person at Binance’s own November blockchain event in Istanbul. Since at least May, Zhao had been mentioning on regular Binance leadership calls that he was preparing to step down, according to four people familiar with the conversations. The UAE does not have an extradition agreement with the United States, so Zhao’s personal legal situation seemed secure. He also has close relationships with powerful Emiratis, and UAE officials were insistent that Zhao had not violated any local laws.Still, pressure was ramping up. A possible deal earlier in 2023 with the US Justice Department that could have been better for Zhao fell though after some officials pushed for him to personally face a stiffer penalty, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Meanwhile, the UAE authorities were desperately seeking to be removed from the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) grey list, which means increased monitoring and is a blemish on the country’s financial reputation. In the end, people familiar with the discussions said the UAE authorities did not play a role in Zhao’s decision to voluntarily fly to the United States and turn himself in to the authorities.However, Zhao frequently came up in conversations between the US and UAE officials in 2023, according to people familiar with the discussions. By mid-November, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority was signalling that it would not grant Binance a full licence to operate imminently with a decision about FATF’s grey list looming in February. More on this TopicWho is Binance billionaire Zhao Changpeng?Former Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng must stay in US for now, judge saysNo headquartersBinance exploded onto the crypto scene in 2017 and almost immediately took on and surpassed larger rivals. It was originally based in China, but following that government’s crackdown on crypto, it moved to Japan and eventually to Malta. Officially, Binance says it has no formal headquarters. US probes into Binance date back to 2018 when the company was only a year old. Various arms of the US Justice Department and US Treasury Department have been involved. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Zhao and Binance in March, and also joined the US$4.3 billion settlement in November. The Securities and Exchange Commission was not part of the settlement announced on Nov 21, and Wall Street’s main regulator appears to be pressing ahead with its June case against Binance and Zhao for allegedly mishandling customer funds and allowing Americans to illegally access the platform. Binance first ended up on Washington’s radar because it was growing so fast – averaging more than US$1 billion in daily transactions in its first year – and had a significant number of US customers, said Mr Jarod Koopman, executive director for cyber and forensic services at the criminal investigation division of the Internal Revenue Service. Mr Koopman said the big moment for the case finally came in the summer of 2022 when investigators discovered the missing piece they had been looking for – internal communications that he said showed Zhao had direct knowledge the company was violating US laws. Meanwhile, Ms Whitney Case, the associate director for enforcement and compliance at the US Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (Fincen), said it was Binance’s own marketing that caught the attention of her agency back in 2018.She said in an interview that the firm was widely advertising that it would not subject clients to identity verification checks for certain types of accounts. Fincen began seeking information directly from the company as early as late 2020, Ms Case said. The effort involved hundreds of thousands of pages of discovery, witness interviews and data analysis to track money flowing in and out of the firm, she said. Officials ultimately said that Binance improperly accepting American users while shirking US laws led to criminal charges against the company and Zhao.\rMore on this TopicBinance sees $1.3 billion in outflows after Zhao steps down to settle US probe Binance was used to funnel money to Hamas, other militant groupsSignificant penaltiesCourt filings in the case show that at the direction of Zhao and other senior Binance executives, employees encouraged those customers to conceal their US connections by creating new accounts and obscuring their locations.Zhao faces a maximum sentence of 10 years and fines as high as US$500,000, plus any profits he made from his alleged crimes. His sentencing is set for February. His plea agreement with the US government includes a waiver of his right to appeal, provided that his sentence does not exceed 18 months. He could return to the company in three years.Meanwhile, Binance is already trying to turn the page – again telegraphing what is coming next to its best clients. In a recent e-mail addressed to VIPs and institutional clients, Mr Teng, the new CEO, said that the company’s best days lie ahead.“I look forward to deepening our relationship as we continue to grow together,” he said. “I will be making an exciting announcement on behalf of Binance VIP and Institutional soon that attests to this commitment.” BLOOMBERGMore on this TopicBinance isn’t FTX.

The deal, in which Binance will pay US$4.3 billion to the US authorities, raises questions over the future of the world’s largest crypto exchange and marks another blow for an industry beset by scandals. Zhao has been replaced by Mr Richard Teng, a Singaporean and former executive at the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Singapore Exchange.It remained unclear on Nov 22 how much jail time, if any, Zhao would ultimately serve and how much influence he – as Binance’s founder and major shareholder – could continue to exert on the company under the terms of the settlement.Some analysts also noted that the deal was unlikely to end the exchange’s US legal woes, with charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleging that Binance broke US securities laws still unresolved.“Binance is not entirely out of the woods. The ongoing civil lawsuit with the SEC remains a concern for the exchange, which (is) likely to result in further fines,” Mr Robert Le, a crypto analyst at data firm PitchBook, wrote in a note. Data from crypto analytics platform Nansen, which does not include Bitcoin flows, signalled that some investors had been rattled by the news, pulling US$956 million from the exchange. Still, the outflows were small relative to the more than US$65 billion of assets that remain on Binance, Nansen said.As it strived for market dominance, Binance shunned key checks that Zhao believed would turn off customers, the authorities said.It failed to report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions, including with organisations the United States described as terrorist groups such as Palestinian militant group Hamas, and never reported transactions with websites dedicated to selling child sexual abuse materials.Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but said on Nov 21 that it had worked hard to make Binance “safer and even more secure”. Lawyers for Zhao did not respond to requests for comment on Nov 22. On Nov 21, he had conceded: “I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility.”While the authorities have probed Zhao and Binance since at least 2018, Zhao’s exit marks a dramatic development for one of the most powerful figures in the crypto industry. Zhao, who resides in the United Arab Emirates, entered his plea in a Seattle court on Nov 21. He faces a maximum prison sentence of 18 months under US guidelines and has agreed not to appeal against any sentence up to that length. Prosecutors will take a position on how much jail time to seek closer to Zhao’s Feb 23 sentencing in Seattle, a Justice Department spokesperson said on Nov 22.“But we do reserve the right to seek a sentence above the guidelines,” said the spokesperson.More on this TopicBinance CEO pleads guilty amid US illicit finance probe; S’porean ex-chief compliance officer chargedBinance was used to funnel money to Hamas, other militant groupsZhao paid a US$175 million bail bond, with another US$15 million held in a trust account, a court filing showed. He has agreed to return to the US 14 days before sentencing.Later on Nov 22, US prosecutors urged a judge to block Zhao from leaving the continental US prior to his February sentencing, saying in a court filing that he posed a serious flight risk despite his bail conditions.Some legal experts said they did not expect Zhao to spend more than a year in prison, and maybe less, citing former chief of crypto exchange BitMEX Arthur Hayes, who likewise pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering violations.Hayes was ultimately sentenced to six months of house arrest in 2022, even though the government sought prison time. Other senior BitMEX executives charged did not serve time. However, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried could spend decades in prison after being found guilty in November of defrauding customers of his now-bankrupt crypto exchange. Based on the alleged facts, prosecutors likely could have charged Zhao with more serious crimes carrying heavier sentences, but had to weigh that against the probability that he would have stayed abroad to avoid capture, legal experts said.The settlement also bars Zhao from “any present or future involvement in operating or managing” Binance, which he founded in 2017 and had maintained a tight grip on since. He remains a major shareholder and said on Nov 21 that he will be “available to the team to consult as needed”, consistent with the deal.“This could give him a hook on which to exercise control – through the usual corporate governance channels (for example, shareholder voting),” Professor Yesha Yadav of Vanderbilt University’s law school wrote in an e-mail to Reuters.“At the same time, I imagine that Binance will be looking to be very careful.” REUTERSMore on this TopicUS seeking more than $5.3 billion from crypto exchange Binance to end case How crypto investors are picking up the pieces Join ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.CryptocurrenciesCEOFinancial crimesThanks for sharing!"}

The coin known as BNB rose as much as 8.5 per cent to US$266.42, and Bitcoin climbed as much as 2.1 per cent to US$37,768.   While that penalty would go down as one of the biggest-ever levied against a company by the United States government, traders and analysts are breathing a sigh of relief for the broader market. There are still questions that need to be answered, including what concessions the government will require of Binance and its leader, but the report provides some clarity that there is a path forward for Binance, said Mr Anil Lulla, co-founder of crypto research firm Delphi Digital.“It would be great to get this behind us”, he said. “It was an overhang in the industry. And while US$4 billion is not an insignificant number, it’s probably a small price for Binance to pay to move forward from this.” While the details of Binance’s finances are a closely held secret, the company generated at least US$20 billion of revenue during the crypto boom in 2021, according to a Bloomberg analysis in 2022 of its trading volume and fees. However, Binance’s combined market share in spot cryptocurrencies and derivatives is on trend to decline for the ninth consecutive month, falling to 43.9 per cent as at Nov 15, according to data compiled by CCData. Crypto exchange OKX has been the largest beneficiary of Binance’s decline in the derivatives market, with its market share rising from 11.2 per cent to 24.9 per cent since the start of 2023, CCData said.Negotiations between the DOJ and Binance include the possibility that Mr Zhao could face criminal charges in the US under an agreement to resolve the probe into alleged money laundering, bank fraud and sanctions violations, according to people familiar with the discussions. He is currently residing in the United Arab Emirates, which does not have an extradition treaty with the US. But that does not prevent him from coming voluntarily. Binance did not respond to e-mails and telephone calls seeking comment. The DOJ declined to comment.This reaction in the market seems to indicate that the DOJ’s decision is not a systemic risk to the entire industry, said Mr Greg Moritz, co-founder and chief operating officer of crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital.“Binance isn’t short on capital and monetary fines are often a cost of doing business in an environment where the rules are ambiguous,” he said. “In the long term, this is almost certainly good news as it provides further clarity on what enforcement will look like; and markets love clarity.”The crypto market has rebounded strongly this year following massive losses in 2022, with Bitcoin more than doubling amid optimism that the Securities and Exchange Commission is poised to approve an exchange-traded fund that invests directly in the oldest and biggest token.

It has targeted the group's investment portfolio and issued an alert to financial institutions on countering Hamas financing while senior officials have discussed the group's access to funds on trips abroad.Separately, the Treasury's top sanctions official, Brian Nelson, on Thursday met with the private sector, including cryptocurrency firms and payment processors, on countering Hamas's fundraising techniques.  Nelson, the Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, heard from the money service businesses, payment processors and blockchain analytic companies on techniques used by the militant group to raise and move funds, the department said in a statement.Nelson \"pledged continued engagement with those who have taken proactive steps to investigate, identify, and disrupt Hamas-related activity,\" the Treasury said.FOCUS ON FACILITATORS IN THIRD COUNTRIESAdeyemo said that while crypto was not where the majority of Hamas' assets come from today, \"Over time, if the crypto industry doesn't put in place safeguards, and take seriously their anti-money-laundering responsibilities, Hamas and others will grow in their use of cryptocurrency.\"This was part of the motivation behind the Treasury-run Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's (FinCEN) proposing a rule under Section 311 of the anti-terrorism USA Patriot Act to designate cryptocurrency \"mixing\" transactions as of primary money laundering concern, requiring financial institutions to monitor and report them.Such transactions combining pools of assets or delaying transaction processing can hide the beneficial ownership of crypto assets, Adeyemo said. Adeyemo said the efforts to cut off Hamas funding will increasingly focus on facilitators in third countries, and it will take coordination with allies and partners to shut off those avenues. His recent trip to Europe centered on fostering more cooperation in this area. \"What I want those who seek to harm Israel or harm the region or to harm us to know, is that we're going to continue to act as long as you act, to cut off your access to financing,\" Adeyemo said.

I can see them exercising more restraint to avoid the spotlight.” While retailers declined to provide figures, Mr William Tan, manager at Watch Exchange, which sells second-hand luxury watches, said any impact of the money laundering bust on the luxury watch scene may be overstated. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch up on the news that everyone’s talking about\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n“There’s maybe a 10 to 15 per cent decrease in people buying watches that cost more than $60,000. I think some clients are trying to keep a low profile after the case was reported in August,” he said, adding that sales figures for watches below the $50,000 mark have not changed.The $2.8 billion money laundering probe cast the spotlight on the lifestyle of the 10 foreigners implicated in the case. Some of them had leased good class bungalows (GCBs) in areas where rents are typically about $100,000 a month. They also allegedly owned luxury watches, including a $7 million Patek Philippe and a $2 million Richard Mille.To date, the police have seized 546 pieces of jewellery, 164 luxury watches, 294 luxury bags and thousands of bottles of liquor and wine as part of the investigation. Some of the handbags cost up to $250,000 each.Chuan Watch’s Mr Lim said he has not noticed any significant change in his clients’ buying behaviour. “If your money is clean, I don’t see why you should be worried about spending it. The only implication I can see is if a dealer has dealt with any of the accused,” he said.More on this TopicSingapore luxury bungalow sales tumble after money laundering bust  Porsche, 2 Rolls-Royces among 4 cars seized from Bukit Timah bungalow in $2.8b money laundering caseProperty slumpMedia reports have linked the ongoing probe to a cooling of Singapore’s luxury property market. Knight Frank reported that demand for rental properties slipped in the second quarter of 2023, with rents in the ultra-luxury segment falling almost 4 per cent, compared with the 9 per cent gain in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, high-end bungalow sales are set for their worst year in nearly a decade, with just eight sold as at the end of September, according to data compiled by the real estate company. This compares with 20 mansions sold in 2022.However, real estate experts, including Ms Christine Sun, senior vice-president of research and analytics at OrangeTee & Tie, have attributed the slowdown in overall sales to buyers turning cautious in the face of higher-for-longer interest rates, slowing economic growth and geopolitical tensions.Instead of a slump, family-owned jeweller Ivy Masterpiece said the firm’s clientele is in fact growing, and so is clients’ spending.Mr Ronald Low, a shareholder in the company, said: “We’ve done better every year since Covid-19. We are still on track for that this year.”He added that bigger spenders are not worried about the ongoing investigation as their funds are from legitimate sources. Ms Belinda Chua, founder of Flower Diamond, said her clients are long-time customers who have personal relationships with her. “Our new clients are also usually introduced to us by existing customers and friends, so a certain level of trust is there,” she added. Regulated dealers of precious stones and metals like Chuan Watch are required to file cash transaction reports (CTR) to the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office, for cash and cash equivalent transactions that exceed $20,000. Regulated dealers are businesses that are registered under the Ministry of Law’s Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Act.  Mr Lim said Chuan Watch has also been briefed by banks on verifying customers’ credit cards, signatures and names. “If customers want to pay for the watches in cash, we will also have to lodge a CTR,” he added. Mr Low said the Law Ministry briefs dealers in the industry on the Act every year. Ivy Masterpiece also hires accounting firm Deloitte to audit the company, to ensure all records are properly documented.The report is submitted to the ministry.“Most of our customers pay by credit cards, so there is a paper trail. We will outright refuse to conduct business with people who try to pay us with stacks of money,” said Mr Low, adding that the firm also conducts its own due diligence when dealing with new or potential customers.Ms Chen Xiaoxun, marketing director of Supreme Cars, said demand for supercars and luxury vehicles remains high.“At Supreme Cars, we have not seen a clear reduction of sales of luxury cars. Our sales volume is more directly affected by financial market sentiments,” she added.Supreme Cars said vehicles under the $300,000 mark continue to sell steadily, and sales of models above $700,000 are holding up well.The dealer currently has 94 luxury vehicles listed for sale on Sgcarmart, an online platform. They include 13 cars with price tags in excess of $1 million each.The money laundering case saw 62 vehicles issued prohibition of disposal orders. The police also seized collectibles including Bearbricks, which are produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy.The police said they seized 56 Bearbrick figurines at another location on Wednesday. PHOTO: SINGAPORE POLICE FORCEBearbrick was introduced in 2001 as a gift to visitors at the World Character Convention in Tokyo.Falken Toys, which sells Bearbricks, said demand for the collectibles has held up, with interest growing because of the case.  “The community has seen a significant increase in interest and awareness regarding the high value of these collectibles,” said a spokesman.In total, the police seized 56 Bearbricks, which experts estimate could be worth up to $500,000 in total. Flashy and noisyMoney managers say their clients are looking at the ongoing investigation with some amusement. Mr Mario Becker, chief executive of Das Family Office, said: “Our clients are looking at the details of the case, and how the accused had (allegedly) spent so much on rent for their bungalows.”A family office typically acts as an asset manager for wealthy families. Mr Becker said families with first-generation wealth are more flashy and noisy, in terms of their spending, something that is not typically seen in established families. “Our clients are looking to see if there are any good opportunities that will come from the case.“Many of those engaging in illicit activities tend to be heavily leveraged, so they will have to sell their assets at any price just to raise money. That is when our clients can come in to buy those assets,” he added. Mr Adrian Koh, head of growth at digital securities exchange Alta, said he has seen a general pullback in spending on luxury goods and assets, with property suffering the most from the money laundering case. “However, we’ve seen that demand for luxury assets like rare whiskies and premium wines has been resilient throughout 2023. “We don’t see investors losing faith in luxury goods as an investment, and investors in our community continue to seek opportunities to add them to their portfolios,” he added. More on this TopicTwo good class bungalows linked to $2.8b money laundering probe vacated S’poreans who helped set up firms linked to $2.8b money laundering case removing their namesJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Financial crimesSingapore economyLuxury brandsThanks for sharing!"}

This framework was outlined in a joint consultation paper by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Infocomm Media Development Authority on Wednesday that seeks to strengthen the direct accountability of financial institutions and telcos to consumers.The move will likely make Singapore the first jurisdiction to include telecommunication operators or other infrastructure service providers in a fraud reimbursement framework. The authorities said placing “duties on responsible telcos” aims to reduce the risk of scam SMSes being sent to consumers.The move is part of a proposed “waterfall approach” that will assess responsibility, with retail banks such as Citibank, DBS, UOB and OCBC, and payment service providers like Grab that offer e-wallets, first in line. This is because they are custodians of consumer funds and so play a critical role as gatekeepers against money being misappropriated by scammers. They have the primary responsibility to implement robust controls to safeguard accounts and to effectively respond to suspicious transactions, the regulators said. If they carry out these duties properly, they will not be required to reimburse phishing victims, particularly those who are duped into revealing their account credentials, such as usernames and passwords, to scammers impersonating legitimate entities such as government agencies or banks.Consumers in such cases will then have to bear the full loss. They can take action by lodging a complaint at the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre.Telcos stand second in line as they are the infrastructure providers for SMS texts. Scammers have tried to impersonate financial institutions and other businesses using SMSes that appear as legitimate ones sent by banks, for example. Not all phishing scams are covered in the proposed framework. Scams covered include those where a fraudster pretends to be from a legitimate entity such as SingPost or DHL and sends e-mails or SMSes claiming account-related issues, to trick victims into clicking a URL link to a fake website to enter their account details.They include those where a scammer claims to be from a financial institution offering deals like high interest rates on fixed deposits and free mobile phones to trick victims into clicking a URL link to a fake website to enter account credentials. Scams where victims authorise payments to a fraudster, such as those arising from investment or love scams, are not covered. Malware scams are not covered either. These usually involve scammers duping people into downloading and installing malicious Android apps, which give remote access to victims’ devices to obtain their Internet banking credentials or credit card details.The new proposals would require banks to impose a 12-hour cooling-off period to prevent large sums from being transferred from an account to a third party if a scammer has phished a person’s credentials and activated a digital security token. They should send alerts to consumers and take preventive measures if the activity is unauthorised.More on this Topic8,500 phishing cases in S'pore in 2022; more than 80% spoofed a bank or financial serviceCan you spot a scam? Why our minds are more susceptible than we thinkA 24/7 reporting channel and self-service feature such as a kill switch should be set up so that consumers can report and block unauthorised access to their accounts.Telcos can deliver a sender identification SMS to a subscriber only if it originates from an authorised aggregator. An aggregator is a link between a business that wants to send an SMS and the mobile phone network that delivers it to a user’s mobile phone.Telcos must block sender identification SMSes from all other channels to prevent consumers from receiving one from unauthorised or unknown networks. They must implement an anti-scam filter for all SMSes and block those with known phishing links.Breaches of these duties would be the starting point for determining who is to be held responsible for losses under the framework, which builds on the work done last year by the Payments Council to counter phishing scams involving financial institutions. The regulators noted on Wednesday that digitally enabled scams that result in unauthorised transactions are of particular concern as they could undermine confidence in Singapore’s digital banking and payments systems.“It is therefore critical for consumers to continue to exercise vigilance at all times and not click on any unsolicited, suspicious links,” they said.The joint consultation paper seeks comments on the scope of the new guidelines, the duties of financial institutions and telcos, and the approach for payouts for scam losses, among other things. An MAS spokesman said the Government will take into account feedback from the public and publish a response to the consultation. It expects to implement the framework in the first half of 2024, he added. The number of phishing scams here involving banks fell from a high of 839 in December 2021 to 113 in May 2022, noted police data.Banks recovered about $57.6 million from different scams in the first nine months of this year, according to the Association of Banks in Singapore on Tuesday, adding that new anti-malware tools have further protected customers from potential losses of at least $18.6 million.Countries like Australia have also considered shared loss schemes as a result of scams. The European Commission has proposed a “refund” to victims of certain types of fraud, while Britain is planning to enforce mandatory reimbursement by banks to scam victims of up to £1 million (S$1.66 million) – with the sending and receiving banks sharing the bill. More on this Topic$1.4 trillion lost to scams globally; S’pore victims lost the most on average: StudyEnhanced international cooperation key to S’pore’s fight against scams: MHA\n\n\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.E-bankingMAS/Monetary Authority of SingaporeIMDA/Infocomm Media Development AuthorityScamsFinancial crimesTelcosBanks and financial institutionsThanks for sharing!"}

Israel has seized crypto accounts it says are linked to Hamas. United States lawmakers have urged the government to crack down on the use of cryptocurrencies by Hamas and its affiliates. But cryptocurrencies are just one way that violent militant groups, and groups designated as terrorist organisations, get and use money. Here’s what we know about crypto’s role.Why is crypto used in illicit finance?Anyone can set up a cryptocurrency wallet address without always having to undergo checks such as those by a bank.The addresses are pseudonymous – labelled only by a string of letters and numbers – which means people can send and receive cryptocurrency without revealing their identity.The blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrency operates digitally and across borders, meaning that it can act as an instant payment system.Crypto is subject globally to less specific regulation than traditional finance, although new rules are being introduced in some regions.The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global body responsible for tackling money laundering and terrorist financing, has warned that crypto assets “risk becoming a safe haven for the financial transactions of criminals and terrorists”. Can crypto not be tracked?Yes. But not always.Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum create a permanent public record of transactions. This means it is possible to see what funds have flowed in and out of a wallet address, and which wallets it interacted with.It is hard for an outsider to identify transactions on the blockchain, but blockchain analytics firms have tools to track funds.Still, in order to link these flows to a person or group, researchers rely on information not recorded by the blockchain.Crypto exchanges can record which addresses belong to which customer, and police can unmask those behind wallets.Cryptocurrency users can further obscure their tracks by the use of crypto “mixers”, or move funds to exchanges or other firms where the funds can become difficult to distinguish from other customers’ assets.How much crypto has been used in terrorist financing?No one knows for sure.Militant groups use different methods to move money, including cash, banks, shell companies and charities, and informal financial networks. Crypto is a small part, experts say.A United Nations official said in 2022 that a couple of years ago, 5 per cent of terrorist attacks were considered to be financed by crypto, but that this may go up to 20 per cent, Bloomberg reported.The FATF said in 2023 that crypto presents “increasing terrorist financing risks”, but noted that the “vast majority” of terrorist financing still uses regular money.When illicit finance flows are identified at a crypto firm, that does not necessarily mean all of that firm’s flows are tainted, blockchain research company Chainalysis said in a blog.Chainalysis said that terrorist financing “represents a small fraction of the less than 1 per cent of the entire crypto market occupied by illicit activity”.Crypto crime hit a record US$20.1 billion (S$27.6 billion) in 2022, Chainalysis said, calling this a lower-bound estimate. This figure excludes instances when cryptocurrencies are the proceeds of non-crypto crimes such as payment for drugs. Cryptocurrency theft via cyber attacks is also a significant source of funding for North Korea, according to UN reports.Some banks in Britain have curbed customers’ access to crypto because of a rise in crypto scams.

Mr Bae Jae-hyun was arrested early on Thursday, according to the Seoul Southern District Court, which issued the warrant. Internet giant Kakao won a controlling stake in SM after an intense bidding war with Hybe, the label behind hit boy group BTS. Financial regulators accused the executive, along with two others working at Kakao and Kakao Entertainment, of buying 240 billion won (S$242.6 million) in shares of SM in an attempt to disrupt Hybe’s tender. The court has not issued warrants for the other two people, and it was unclear whether there would be more arrests. Both Kakao and Hybe had seen ownership of SM as a way to reach a broader audience and to drive South Korean entertainment acts into the mainstream, and their bidding war sent SM’s stock price to a record. Hybe backed down from its takeover bid in March. The lawyer representing Kakao executives, who previously said the purchase of SM shares was a legitimate market transaction, was not immediately available for comment. Neither were Kakao officials. Kakao shares fell around 2 per cent in morning trade, down around 23 per cent from the start of 2023. Shares of SM were down over 2 per cent, but still up 54 per cent so far this year.

Financial firms here were estimated to have spent US$3.8 billion on compliance costs in 2020, up 22 per cent from US$3.1 billion in 2019, according to data and analytics provider LexisNexis Risk Solutions. Compliance screening aims to detect and deter crime, protect an institution’s reputation and satisfy regulatory demands. It typically involves validating a customer’s identity and sources of funds  and assessing potential risks. The latest study surveyed more than 1,000 global decision-makers involved with financial crime compliance strategy at banks and other institutions.All said they spent more on financial crime compliance in the past year. Those in Europe, the Middle East and Africa incurred the highest cost at US$85 billion while Latin America was the lowest at US$15 billion.Financial institutions in North America and Latin America ranked taking on new customers as their No. 1 challenge. Those in Europe, the Middle East and Africa struggled the most with customer risk profiling, while those in the Asia-Pacific found regulatory reporting toughest.Many found it challenging to identify direct and indirect relationships between business entities and undertake risk profiling of both companies and customers.They also struggled with the sharp increase in crime alerts amid the numerous false positives. The study showed that the growing complex web of global regulations and sanctions, coupled with stringent security checks, have dampened the customer experience. “This puts many financial institutions in the precarious position of balancing customer satisfaction and regulatory adherence. It creates hindrances even for performing routine transactions,” Mr Ramanathan Sivabalan, director of financial crime compliance and payments for Asia-Pacific at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, told The Straits Times.He expects scrutiny to increase for higher-income customers, following a money laundering blitz in Singapore where more than $2.8 billion worth of assets have been seized or issued with prohibition of disposal orders.“Consequently, one can say that his or her experience with the banker is not going to be as smooth as it was in the past,” added Mr Sivabalan. More than half of the study’s respondents globally reported a surge in crimes facilitated by digital payments, cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence technologies.

They have risen as banks pivot towards digital operations and remote working. Outsourcing to external parties is another major cost, along with staff training in financial compliance-related roles. “To beat the cyber criminals and thwart their more sophisticated financial crimes, banks must leverage advanced technologies and data analytics to identify new crime patterns rapidly,” Mr Sivabalan said.More on this TopicMAS records highest civil penalties for financial crimes in latest enforcement reportMAS to build platform for banks to share customer info in fight against financial crime\n\n\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Financial crimesBanks and financial institutionsSingaporeThanks for sharing!"}

Take 32-year-old Phoebe, who recently moved almost one million yuan (S$190,000). To do it, she first had to transfer her money into the account of a local facilitator. Then, Phoebe, who requested to be identified by only her first name because of privacy and legal concerns, had to sit tight. A few tense hours later, transactions began to pop piecemeal into a separate account she holds in Hong Kong. Once the cash is there, it can go anywhere. The funds that appeared in Phoebe’s account came from 10 people in total – one of whom deposited the equivalent of US$1,300 (S$1,800) in notes via an ATM. The transaction moved through an informal, unregulated system known around the world as hawala. On one side of the administrative border between the mainland and Hong Kong, Phoebe handed over her money to members of her facilitator’s network; on the other side, the transaction was mirrored by others in the network who dropped money into her account. The entire operation was dependent on faith. But Phoebe’s wait was not quite as nerve-jangling as you might expect: She had been referred to the remittance agency – which is illegal in China – by her established, well-­regarded wealth manager introduced via mutual connections. Since international borders reopened post-pandemic, advisers to the rich have reported a surge in demand for overseas backup options. Crackdowns on industries that are ideologically out of favour, uncertainty over geopolitical tensions and President Xi Jinping’s push for “common prosperity” have spooked the rich and even the middle class. In addition, the domestic economy looks increasingly dire. Many wealthy families feel it is essential to have money outside the country, whether to diversify assets or to pave the way for potential future immigration. Traditional havens still hold their allure – think a condominium in Vancouver or US equity investments – but over the past two years, Singapore has increasingly emerged as a favoured ­destination.Yet opportunities to move cash legitimately from China are severely limited, with individuals normally allowed to wire only US$50,000 a year overseas. They also have a one-time opportunity to move their money when they emigrate. Plugging the gap is where the underground networks come into play. “These agencies have sprouted to meet soaring demand,” said adjunct finance professor Joel Gallo at New York University Shanghai. “They act as quasi-banking firms, yet operate without the scrutiny of one and adroitly engage in regulatory arbitrage by standing in a grey zone.” There is no reliable estimate on how big the industry is, but probes disclosed by the authorities suggest an enormous scale. One investigation in China’s western Gansu province uncovered an operation with 75.6 billion yuan in assets, state media reported in 2021, citing China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange. The money was spread among a network of five organisations that used more than 8,000 bank accounts across more than 20 provinces. The networks are truly global in scope, operating not only in Hong Kong but wherever there are significant numbers of the Chinese diaspora. It is “highly likely” that underground banks will have pools of funds ready in key locations, so recipients can receive their cash quickly, and in the local currency, according to a 2019 intelligence assessment by Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA). Linking up with one of these money shops, though, is not a decision to be taken lightly. People caught using illegal currency ­exchange services in mainland China are usually fined 30 per cent or more of the amount of money they attempted to transfer. If the sum is significant, those providing the service face significant jail time. Although the maximum penalty of a life sentence is typically handed down only when there are compounding offences like bribery, reports of sentences ranging from one to five years are common. Although China’s capital laws do not apply if you are in the likes of Hong Kong, Britain or Singapore, there is a risk of legitimate banks getting suspicious about the source of funds. A spokesperson for the Monetary Authority of Singapore said that while Singapore does not implement the capital controls of other jurisdictions, the regulator requires financial institutions, including remittance agents, to detect and report suspicious transactions and behaviour. Institutions are also required to mitigate reputational, legal and operational risk from activities affected by other jurisdictions’ laws. Singapore’s banks have reason to be on especially high alert: In August, the authorities arrested and charged 10 people with Chinese origins with a range of crimes including money laundering. More than $2.8 billion of cash and other assets were frozen or confiscated. The allegations involve attempts to move proceeds from illicit activities such as scams and illegal gambling, not remittances. More on this TopicChina’s ultra-rich Gen Zs flock home as global tensions rise Wealthy Chinese nationals in Singapore: Tales of rags to riches and hard workBut there is a dark side to remittance operations. To ultimately settle exchanges via hawala, Chinese underground banks regularly use cash generated by criminal groups through activities such as drug trafficking, cigarette smuggling, organised illegal immigration and human trafficking, according to the NCA. For example, a gang with operations in both China and Britain might front the money to pay a hawala recipient in London and then get paid a corresponding amount by the underground bankers in Shanghai. The British law enforcers found that Chinese student accounts were sometimes used as a back door to get money into the legitimate banking system. The NCA identified more than 100 people who had made cash deposits into more than 14,000 personal bank accounts held or set up predominantly by Chinese students. The amount of cash put into these accounts in a 12-month period totalled in excess of £100 million (S$167 million), with some of the people parking more than £2.5 million each. Right now, there are increasing signs that more money is looking to leave. Real estate consultancy Juwai IQI said in August that it expects more than 700,000 Chinese to exit the country in the next two years. Top destinations for buying property – based on searches on its site – include Australia, Canada and Britain. Singapore ­introduced a 60 per cent property tax for foreign purchasers in April, which has crimped mid-market demand. If more cash flows out of China than into it, that means not all remittance requests can be satisfied by mirrored transactions, and agencies need to find ways to actually get money across the border. Clamping down on these routes has been a long-running game of cat and mouse. The Chinese authorities have swatted simple options such as cash being moved in suitcases or car boots or sailed to Hong Kong in junks. Increased scrutiny of overseas acquisitions has reduced the opportunities to get money out by paying an inflated price for firms outside China. The crackdown on crypto has also made it much harder to use digital currency as a workaround. Yet there are still ways. One popular technique is known as “smurfing”. It involves recruiting people on the mainland who have not used their legitimate remittance quotas of US$50,000. By using many people, the agencies can then use their bank accounts and small individual allowances to funnel large amounts of money outside the country. Case investigations disclosed by the government show that this can sometimes reach epic scale. One man, surnamed Li, recruited 102 individuals to help send C$6.8 million (S$6.8 million) in 2020, state media reported. Even if moving money out of China becomes more difficult, experts do not foresee any let-up in overall attempts. Based on unexplained discrepancies in tourist data – which suggest Chinese tourists are leaving cash abroad when they travel – as much as US$150 billion is expected to exit in 2023, according to an estimate from senior economist Gary Ng at French investment bank Natixis.

A Su Baolin appeared in NKF’s annual reports from 2020 to 2022, in a list of people who donated at least $5,000 annually to the organisation.Cambodian national Su Baolin, 41, faces two forgery charges.The 10 accused are (clockwise from top left) Su Baolin, Su Haijin, Chen Qingyuan, Su Wenqiang, Lin Baoying, Zhang Ruijin, Wang Dehai, Su Jianfeng, Vang Shuiming and Wang Baosen.ST ILLUSTRATIONS: CEL GULAPAAn NKF spokeswoman said the charity could not confirm if it was the same Su Baolin involved in the case, and did not say if it was aware of any donations made by anyone linked to the money laundering case.She said NKF has a policy of due diligence checks on its donations, to provide beneficiaries with “reasonable assurance” that the donation did not come from any illegal source.“In instances where there are concerns about the ethical implications of a potential or suspicious donation, a decision will be made to decline the donation following the due diligence check,” she said, adding that the relevant authorities would be notified, if necessary.Rainbow Centre did not reply by press time. Lions Befrienders executive director Karen Wee said it received a $5,000 donation in 2022 from one of the 10, but declined to reveal the person’s name. Ms Wee said: “Even though the amount of money was small compared to the $2.1 million we raised in 2022-2023, we made a police report because Lions Befrienders is about transparency and accountability.   “We will return the money if we have to.” More on this TopicRainbow Centre to review policies after confirming it received $72k from money laundering accused$2.8b money laundering case: What happens to tainted donations?On Aug 15, more than 400 officers led by the Commercial Affairs Department raided locations including Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley.Nine men and one woman, originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.It is Singapore’s worst money laundering case and one of the world’s largest.There were earlier media reports of Sian Chay Medical Institution receiving donations from some of the accused.On Aug 24, the social service agency told ST the amounts included a cheque of $100,000 each from Su Haijin, Su Baolin and Zhang Ruijin in 2020, which were then given to the President’s Challenge.Sian Chay’s spokesman added that from 2020 to 2022, Su Haijin donated an additional $101,000 in total to the organisation.  Su Baolin donated an additional $39,000 from 2021 to 2023 in total, while Zhang Ruijin donated an additional $12,000 in 2021. On Aug 30, Zhang Ruijin’s defence lawyer, in arguing for his client to be granted bail, said in court he had been active in doing charity work, and had donated to local charities.On Tuesday, Mrs Teo said the Commissioner of Charities will be issuing an advisory to encourage all charities to review donor records to check if they have received donations from the 10 accused or entities that are related to them. Charities that find irregularities must file suspicious transaction reports (STRs), she added. More on this TopicHow $2.8b money laundering probe affects S’pore’s economy, property and charities  Under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, individuals or organisations must file an STR if they know or reasonably suspect that a property – in this case, a cash donation – may be linked to serious crimes, including money laundering. An individual who fails to do so may be fined up to $250,000 or jailed for up to three years, while an organisation can be fined up to $500,000. Ms Victoria Ting, associate director at Setia Law, said whether a charity organisation can be taken to task depends on whether it should have reasonably suspected the source of donations could be tainted. The former deputy public prosecutor, who specialised in white-collar crime, said red flags include a mismatch between the donor and donation. She said: “For example, when a donation in the name of a company is wired from a personal account, or an unusually large donation is received which does not seem commensurate with the donor’s known background or income.” Another red flag, she said, is when a large donation is “smurfed” – a tactic money launderers use to split up transfers into multiple smaller amounts, which suggests an intention to avoid triggering reporting requirements.But the task could be daunting for charities that may not be equipped to handle such checks. More on this TopicBattling the scourge of money launderingLions Befriender’s Ms Wee said: “We have multiple sources of donations and a large volume of donors, and it is difficult to do in-depth checks on each of them.”She said that for organisations like hers, typically only large amounts above $10,000 would trigger greater scrutiny. This includes verification checks to ensure the donation is not from someone blacklisted by the police or who has a dubious background or businesses. The organisation has limited methods to conduct background checks on potential donors. Ms Wee said checks can be done with the credit bureau, but this will work only if the businesses or individuals are operating in Singapore. Otherwise, she said, they rely on public announcements or police updates on potential offenders.“Ultimately, what kinds of checks charities do and which donors we check on is a judgment call that we need to make based on the limited resources we have,” she added. More on this TopicOne or more in money laundering case may be linked to family offices given tax incentivesProperty transactions in $2.8b money laundering case likely had minimal impact on prices: Indranee  Meanwhile, Ms Ting said money launderers donate to charities for several reasons.She said: “Where the charity is legitimate, it could be to lower their taxable income, to obtain goodwill and standing in the community, or even just to acquire good karma.  “On the other hand, where charities can also be entirely controlled by a criminal group, then it could operate as a front to receive and transmit illicit payments akin to any other shell company.”ST reported on Sept 18 that some Chinese businessmen had tried to offer money in the form of donations, in exchange for honorary titles in clan associations. Mr Or Teck Seng, general secretary of the Singapore Ann Kway Association, said: “From my understanding, this is to show they are assimilating into society, which is one of the prerequisites of either becoming a Singapore citizen or getting permanent resident status.”Lawyer Chenthil Kumarasingam, a partner at Withers KhattarWong, said some criminals may use charity organisations to hide their ill-gotten gains. “Essentially, the idea is to pass the funds through the charity’s bank accounts and then access them later, whether through corruption in the charity or setting up sham charities to accept the funds from a directed donation,” he said.

This means the charity’s officers could face personal liabilities if they had knowingly accepted illicit funds, or if investigations reveal that due diligence had not been conducted to verify the sources of donations.

Property agents, precious metals dealers and golf clubs here have also been drawn into the scandal, raising questions about the guardrails against illicit money flowing into one of the world’s most important financial hubs.Mr Gupta said banks had already been more cautious over the last 15 years since the global financial crisis. Not only did they invest in anti-fraud technology, but they also leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) to better understand their customers, their backgrounds, sources of funds and wealth, as well as the types of transactions being executed. “It’s not just the people and technology, but some of the biggest advances in AI in banking are in this space, such as fuzzy logic and network link analysis.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch up on the news that everyone’s talking about\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs banks are expected to be the “global policeman”, technology is used to help check for sanctions, terrorism financing and money laundering.“But at the same time, we’re moving trillions of dollars and billions of transactions every day.

In June, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Binance Holdings, Mr Zhao and Binance.US of mishandling customer funds, misleading investors and regulators, and breaking securities rules. Mr Zhao and the companies have denied the allegations.  The exchange, which is formally called BAM Trading Services, was started in 2019 for United States users, who are prohibited from using Binance Holdings. \rIn March, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission charged Binance Holdings and Mr Zhao with “willful evasion of federal law”. The Justice Department is probing the firm, which it has not accused of any wrongdoing, as well.Soon after the SEC action, customers of Binance.US became unable to deposit or withdraw dollars, a consequence of multiple banking partners cutting ties with the platform. The firm has had to resort to an alternative method for Binance.US users to convert dollars into crypto.Binance.US’ share of the global market has shrunken to about 0.6 per cent from 2.39 per cent in April, according to Mr Jacob Joseph, an analyst at researcher CCData. Monthly trading volume has fallen below early 2020 levels, he added. Said the firm in a statement: “The actions we are taking today provide Binance.US with more than seven years of financial runway and enable us to continue to serve our customers while we operate as a crypto-only exchange,” a spokesman said in a statement. “The SEC’s aggressive attempts to cripple our industry and the resulting impacts on our business have real-world consequences for American jobs and innovation, and this is an unfortunate example of that.”Binance.US laid off an unspecified number of workers after the SEC action, Bloomberg reported in June.\rBinance Holdings has been shedding executives and other employees in recent months as well. In September, two executives overseeing regions including Eastern Europe and Russia left.

In applying for the continued detention without bail for the 10 accused, prosecutors argued that the individuals are linked not just to each other, but also to suspects who fled Singapore and some who are based overseas.After the bust on Aug 15, police here conducted a second raid on Sept 1, based on intelligence from the foreign authorities that had uncovered assets belonging to the 10 that were previously hidden.Thus far, police have identified two individuals in court – Suspect X and Subject Y.Subject YOn Sept 6, the court heard that Subject Y is the cousin of Wang Baosen, a 31-year-old Chinese national who is currently facing two money laundering charges here relating to monies from illegal remote gambling.Assets worth more than $18 million have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders relating to Wang Baosen’s case. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch up on the news that everyone’s talking about\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice also took control of assets owned by his wife, He Huifang, who is a director of two firms registered in Singapore – Huixia Technology and Huixia Technology Investment.The court was told that one property owned by He Huifang, who claimed to be an investment consultant, was worth more than $14 million.In an affidavit filed by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD), the investigation officer said Wang Baosen is a high flight risk as he does not have employment in Singapore and has sources of income overseas, including 1 million yuan (S$189,000) he received from his family’s tea plantation business in China.The investigating officer, who submitted the affidavit to have Wang Baosen denied bail, wrote: “I believe the accused faces serious offences for which there is early credible evidence. It would therefore be a great injustice should the accused manage to abscond and evade his charges.”The officer also said the Singapore Police Force is trying to get information from counterparts overseas on the location and activities of Subject Y, who is currently on the run.The affidavit added that more than $100 million worth of assets in Singapore belonging to Subject Y had been seized or issued prohibition of disposal orders.The Straits Times had on Sept 3 revealed that Wang Baosen has close links to members of the Hongli gambling syndicate in Cambodia. They include 34-year-old Wang Bingang and 36-year-old Wang Cailin, who set up the Hongli300 online gambling website in the Philippines in 2013.The website mainly operated “live” video online gambling for popular games such as baccarat and blackjack. It also dabbled in betting projects for sports and e-sports. It was reported by the Chinese media that the syndicate recruited family members to be part of the gambling website’s operations, with Wang Bingang allegedly recruiting Wang Baosen to assist with the finance operations of the website in early 2014.This was just before Hongli’s operations were moved to Cambodia in March 2014.  The authorities shut down the illegal gambling website in October 2014. By then, it was already churning about 980 million yuan in transactions.Wang Bingang and Wang Cailin were later jailed for three years each by a district court in China in 2015. Wang Baosen was investigated in relation to the case.The police did not identify Subject Y, but checks by ST showed that Wang Bingang is a person of interest to the Singapore authorities in relation to the money laundering case. He is an associate of the 10 accused, according to a list sent by the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) to dealers of precious metals and stones. The list, which contains a total of 34 names including the 10 accused, was sent out on Aug 27 with instructions to dealers to review “transactions and business relations to assess if there are any reasonable grounds to suspect criminal conduct, including money laundering, in connection to the police investigation”.ST found that Wang Bingang is a member of Sentosa Golf Club, having obtained membership in early 2022. At least four of the 10 accused are also members of the exclusive club, which costs around $950,000 for foreigners to join.Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority records showed Wang Bingang did not have any current or past appointments with registered businesses here. His registered address was in Rochalie Drive in Tanglin, where good class bungalows are located.Wang Bingang shares an address with Wang Liyun, another associate of the 10 accused, according to the MinLaw list.Wang Liyun is listed as director of two consultancy companies set up in 2020, and is also the shareholder of a bridal house, a photo studio and a restaurant.The restaurant at Orchard Plaza, Jiang Hu Xia Ke, was previously asked to temporarily close in 2020 after staff were caught serving beer from metal teapots and flouting Covid-19 safety rules amid the pandemic.More on this TopicSuspects nabbed in money laundering case can be held without bail until police probe is over: LawyersWives of 10 arrested in money laundering case among suspects linked to probe Suspect XProsecutors on Sept 5 revealed that one of the accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – had communicated with a Suspect X, who is no longer in Singapore, about illegal activities. Vang, a 42-year-old Turkish national, currently faces one forgery charge and four money laundering charges.The investigator said that on Aug 31, CAD received information on at least $3 million in assets that were moved in Vang’s name by a person of interest. This was done after his arrest. These assets were linked to others previously not known to CAD, and amount to more than US$30 million (S$41 million). The police here have seized more than $260 million worth of assets belonging to Suspect X. The police here did not identify Suspect X, but said he is wanted in connection to the ongoing probe, and in China for online gambling activities. Vang’s brother, Wang Shuiting, is on the MinLaw list. He is also one of eight suspects on the run from the probe here.ST reported on Sept 3 that the brothers have alleged links to the Heng Bo Bao Wang gambling syndicate, which had a base in Cambodia. The syndicate was behind the operations of illegal gambling services.According to a notice issued by the Chinese authorities in August 2023, the group developed and maintained several online casinos, and either provided the services directly or leased the gambling services out to others to operate.\rThe syndicate was uncovered and dismantled in May 2022, with the authorities in China arresting 131 suspects and seizing more than 10 million yuan. Nine suspects linked to the group, who were living abroad, became fugitives.They allegedly include Wang Shuiting and Vang, who the police said is closely associated with two of the 10 accused – Su Haijin and Su Baolin.The notice from the authorities in China urged the nine to return to the country, saying if they did so voluntarily before Oct 10, 2023, they may be granted leniency.Checks by ST found that the brothers have Cambodian citizenship, with Vang being granted his in March 2019, and Wang Shuiting in November 2018.Wang Shuiting is also a Sentosa Golf Club member, having gained his membership in the first half of 2022.

They include four properties and three vehicles, worth more than $29 million in total, almost $1 million in cash, and 11 condominium units still under construction.Some of these assets are jointly held with his wife Wang Ruiyan, who is the director of Ming Huang Investments and Ming Huang Management, firms registered in Singapore.Wang Ruiyan is also a person of interest in the case, according to the MinLaw list.\n\n\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Money launderingOrganised crimeAcra/Accounting and Corporate Regulatory AuthoritySingapore crimeFinancial crimesFraudGamblingThanks for sharing!"}

PHOTO: REUTERSUPDATED Nov 15, 2024, 11:03 AMThanks for sharing!MANHATTAN – Sam Bankman-Fried used stolen customer funds to make more than US$100 million (S$135.5  million) in campaign contributions ahead of the 2022 US midterm elections, federal prosecutors said on Monday in a new indictment filed against the founder of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange.The new indictment charges the 31-year-old former billionaire with seven counts of conspiracy and fraud over the collapse of the exchange. He has previously pleaded not guilty.Mr Mark Botnick, a spokesman for Bankman-Fried, declined to comment.Bankman-Fried rode a boom in cryptocurrency values to build a net worth estimated at US$26 billion, and became an influential donor to mostly Democratic candidates and causes.The US Attorney’s Office in Manhattan had initially charged him with violating US campaign finance laws, but dropped that charge in late July after the Bahamas said it had never intended to extradite Bankman-Fried to the United States on that charge. FTX was based in the Bahamas and he was arrested there in December 2022.In a letter last week to US District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan, prosecutors indicated they would soon file a new indictment that “will make clear that Mr Bankman-Fried remains charged with conducting an illegal campaign finance scheme as part of the fraud and money laundering schemes originally charged”.

He was not asked to assist in other investigations or interviews with the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD), the company said in a bourse filing on Monday.These previous investigations had resulted in his arrest and release on bail over suspicions that he violated the Securities and Futures Act (SFA) and concerned an abortive share buyback transaction on Jan 31, 2019. Lim said he was not provided with any information during these investigations to believe otherwise.The police said last Thursday that Lim had been charged with share price rigging offences under the SFA. If convicted, he may be jailed for up to seven years or fined up to $250,000, or both.The fresh charges arose from a joint investigation by the CAD and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Lim – the grandson of the founder of No Signboard – was charged with three counts under Section 197(1)(b) of the SFA for creating a false appearance related to the price of Catalist-listed No Signboard shares.\rHe had allegedly placed orders for No Signboard shares and traded them under the trading account of Gugong for the purpose of pushing up or supporting the stock’s price, between June 19 and June 29, 2018, as well as between Nov 30, 2018, and Jan 11, 2019. GuGong is an entity controlled by Lim.In a bourse filing last Friday, No Signboard’s board said the investigating authorities had not approached the board or the firm during the course of the probe, nor revealed any details of the charges.But the firm received queries from the Singapore Exchange last Thursday through its sponsor, PrimePartners Corporate Finance.The board’s nomination committee is formulating its view on Lim’s suitability to remain as a board member and key management of No Signboard.

The Munich district court received a letter written by Marsalek’s lawyer, a spokesman for the institution said on Tuesday, declining to comment on details.Marsalek, 43, has been one of the key figures behind Wirecard’s spectacular rise to one of Germany’s most valuable companies before its implosion in June 2020. At the time, Wirecard admitted that €1.9 billion (S$2.82 billion) it had reported as assets probably never existed. Marsalek fled when the scandal broke and is believed to be hiding in Russia or Belarus. He is on Interpol’s most wanted list and a Munich trial against him and other suspects continues.German weekly business news magazine WirtschaftsWoche first reported on the letter. Marsalek used the correspondence to reject claims that Wirecard’s third-party business did not exist and accused one of the key witnesses in the ongoing fraud trial of having lied several times, the magazine reports.Marsalek’s actions at Wirecard have been a key subject at the Munich trial as Markus Braun, Wirecard’s former chief executive, and other defendants have sought to pin the blame on their one-time colleague.At a hearing in 2022, Braun’s lawyer said the evidence suggests Marsalek and others set up an elaborate system to channel money out of Wirecard and into their own pockets, without Braun’s knowledge. When Braun testified in February, he said that Marsalek was responsible for the unit that handled the so-called Third Party Agreements business that later became the centre of the corporate crisis. It involved payment processing handled by contractors in jurisdictions where Wirecard did not have a licence itself.   When the Financial Times in 2019 questioned the validity of the contracts and how they were booked at Wirecard, the company hired KPMG to look into the matter. Braun said he hoped the probe would end all questions.   While Marsalek initially argued against the step, he later supported the review, Braun said. But then in February 2020 Marsalek surprised him by telling him out of the blue that a few months earlier he had changed the banks that held an escrow account for Wirecard, moving the money from Singapore to two banks in the Philippines, Braun told the court. “I asked him whether he had lost his mind,” Braun said. But he told him that “this way we would lower the risk the funds could be frozen”.Marsalek joined Wirecard in 2000 as an IT project manager and quickly built a reputation for programming, gaining the attention of Braun, a fellow native of Vienna. After Braun rose to the top job, Marsalek was tasked with keeping Wirecard’s global business humming – and expanding.While Germany has had its share of accounting scandals and high-profile corporate collapses, few compare with Wirecard because the failure marked the first time that a company listed on Germany’s benchmark DAX index went bust. Wirecard was long seen as Germany’s ticket to the world of digital payment systems as the world shopped, played and communicated online. When it all turned out to be built on sand, politicians and regulators faced tough questions how a sophisticated economy like Germany could have been so easily tricked, and why nobody followed up on early warnings.Marsalek escaped from Austria to Belarus on a private aircraft in 2020, according to an Austrian warrant. Various news media reports have put him everywhere from Russia to a secret hideaway in Turkey to a tropical island.

Pleading guilty to their charges, Lin Eng Jue was handed a 42-month jail term; Ang Wei Jie Simon received 13 months; Koh Cheo Leng 19 weeks; and Chong Yew Mun Alan 11 weeks, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said on Thursday. They were the last four of eight individuals convicted in court for their part in a scheme to carry out trades aimed at creating a false impression of the price of Koyo shares.The scheme members were sentenced between Feb 19, 2020, and July 13, 2023, with Chong being the last to be sentenced.Between August 2014 and January 2016, the scheme members obtained control of 53 trading accounts opened in the name of 15 individuals to buy and sell Koyo shares at progressively higher prices. This was done with the aim of attracting a buyer to acquire the company via a reverse takeover.Koyo’s share price rose from a low of $0.16 on Aug 12, 2014, to a high of $0.40 on Jan 14, 2016. It then plummeted to $0.056 on Jan 18, 2016, after the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading (SGX-ST) issued a “trade-with-caution” alert on the back of unusual trading activity, and several brokerages imposed trading curbs.MAS said: “Following the crash, account holders suffered losses of approximately $3.28 million, of which $1.05 million were borne by the brokerages and remisiers.”Among the eight, Lin committed the most offences: one count of false trading under Section 197(1)(b) of the Securities and Futures Act (SFA), 15 counts of deception under Section 201(b) of the SFA, and 34 counts of Section 201(b) of the SFA were considered for his sentencing.\rHe was sentenced on May 31, 2023.

Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said in a written answer on Wednesday that there had been 20 investigations from June 1, 2018, to June 23, 2023. He was responding to a parliamentary question from MP Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC). He also said the new Cosmic platform announced in April should be ready by the second half of 2024. Companies on the platform can share information about suspicious customers, and report dubious behaviour earlier and with greater accuracy to the authorities. Regarding Singapore’s anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing rules, Mr Tharman said MAS not only has strict requirements in line with international standards, but it also actively supervises institutions to ensure they adhere to the requirements and expectations.Among the 17 firms penalised, one had its licence revoked while 14 were fined. A further two financial institutions were issued reprimands. Among the 14 fined were DBS Bank, OCBC Bank and Citibank Singapore, along with insurer Swiss Life Singapore. They had been implicated in the Wirecard scandal and were fined $3.8 million in June for failing to comply with the rules, and were also deemed to have inadequate controls in place. Mr Tharman said that even before the Wirecard scandal, MAS had checked for the misuse of legal entities, such as shell companies, which was a risk that arose in the Wirecard-related cases. He added that the firms that MAS inspected were already strengthening their controls as a consequence of the supervisory interventions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch up on the news that everyone’s talking about\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Tharman stressed that the need for active collaboration among financial institutions, MAS and law enforcement was essential in the fight against financial crime.  MAS and the Commercial Affairs Department work closely with key firms to share analyses of emerging risks, as well as information on specific cases.

Currently, there was no impact on production, a spokesman said.\rThe authorities in Japan say such attacks are on the rise.

Australia’s Treasury has referred the leak to the Australian Federal Police for a criminal investigation.At a parliamentary committee hearing in Canberra on Tuesday, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Kennedy, who is one of the country’s most powerful civil servants, described PwC’s conduct as “disturbing”. He said PwC had not “systematically failed us on an ongoing basis”, but reforms were needed to prevent further similar incidents.“Do we have cause to more carefully look at these issues, to review and reform the Tax Practitioners Board, to increase the penalties available, to do all those things?” he asked. “The answer to that is clearly yes.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet insights on Asia’s most pressing issues from our regional correspondents\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe board is a body that regulates tax agents.The Australian Tax Office told the parliamentary committee on Tuesday that PwC was behind a series of schemes designed to help multinationals sidestep tax laws.

The e-mails, uncovered by Parliament, redacted the e-mail addresses.Ms O’Neill said PwC had tried to cover up the scandal and accused it of being “contemptuous” of the public.

The previous Liberal-National coalition government spent A$20.8 billion on consultants and advisers in 2020-21 after moving to limit the size of the civil service. Parliamentary research found that PwC holds A$453.7 million worth of federal contracts, including major work for the Department of Defence.Labor, which defeated the coalition in an election in May last year, has pledged to scale back the use of consultants, describing them as a “shadow workforce”.The most populous state, New South Wales, which spends about A$175 million a year on consultants, has said that it will look at imposing multimillion-dollar penalties on advisers and firms that share confidential tax-related information.The Greens party has called for the federal government to stop hiring PwC and to review the firm’s current contracts. But the government said it cannot simply abandon existing contracts, adding that PwC may struggle to win new contracts until it has adequately dealt with the tax leak.Commentator Jennifer Hewett said on Tuesday that the scandal was “turbocharging doubts about extensive use of consultants”.“The whole saga can only intensify questions about the adequacy of government controls and processes in inevitable interactions with the private sector,” she wrote in the Australian Financial Review.More on this TopicAustralia aims to cut tax breaks for pension funds of the super rich  Singtel-owned Optus refutes allegations of making  illegal donations to Australian political parties Mr Collins gained access to confidential information while advising the federal government in 2015 on measures to prevent tax avoidance by multinational companies.

Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim – whose star was rising in the ruling Umno – was finance minister in 1997, having replaced Tun Daim Zainuddin in 1991. But in a power struggle with then Premier Mahathir Mohamad, Mr Anwar was sacked in September 1998 and later jailed.Mr Daim was reinstated at the Treasury, only to suddenly resign in June 2001 and be replaced by Tun Dr Mahathir amid talk of disagreements between the two. Dr Mahathir then appointed Tan Sri Nor Mohamed Yakcop as special economic adviser, to oversee a swathe of corporate restructuring deals in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis.After the uproar over the UEM-Renong deal – which appeared to breach stock exchange reporting rules – the Securities Commission compelled Tan Sri Halim Saad, then the controlling shareholder of Renong, to buy back the stake from UEM. Payments were to be made between February 2001 and April 2002.But in July 2001, the government decided that sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional would take over the entire Renong group for RM4 billion. Renong included the likes of Plus – the owner of the North-South Expressway – and Commerce Asset Holdings (now CIMB), as well as RM12 billion in debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet exclusive insights on Malaysia weekly\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prevailing view was that this was a government bailout. But Mr Halim – who grew his empire when Mr Daim was finance minister from 1984 to 1991 – unsuccessfully sued the government, Khazanah and Mr Nor Mohamed in 2013 for RM1.8 billion. He insisted he was cheated of his Renong stake, and claimed he had been induced by Mr Nor Mohamed, as an agent of the government, to take up the deal to exit from Renong.Malaysia’s anti-graft body is currently investigating this 26-year-old deal. To this day, it remains unclear when UEM bought the Renong shares, or from whom. Mr Halim had claimed it was from the open market, but trading volume recorded suggests this was not the case.

At this stage, no assumption should be made that any of the banks have broken the law, the CMA said. “A properly functioning, competitive bond market benefits tens of millions of taxpayers and pension savers as well as being at the heart of the UK’s reputation as a global financial hub,” said Mr Michael Grenfell, executive director of enforcement at the CMA. “These alleged activities are therefore very serious and warrant the detailed investigation we have undertaken. “This could have denied taxpayers, pension savers and financial institutions the benefits of full competition for these products, including the minimisation of borrowing costs.” The CMA said it would now consider further representations from the banks before reaching a final decision on next steps.

Johnston, according to a probation report filed on Tuesday in federal court in Brooklyn, New York.The report did not elaborate on Shkreli’s duties or say how or when he got the job. Neither the law firm nor Shkreli’s attorney immediately responded to messages seeking comment.\rWhen contacted by phone, Shkreli said: “I will only comment if you give me significant financial compensation.”\rThe former Turing Pharmaceuticals chief executive did have an initial delay in carrying out his mandatory community service of 20 hours a month, which resulted in a technical violation of his supervision, according to the filing. Shkreli blamed the delay on scheduling conflicts and mental health issues and has been in compliance since April 3.\rShkreli also completed his mandatory therapy appointments in 2022, the probation office said, but he will be “re-referred for mental health treatment” due to his “self-reported struggles”.

Don’t wait two years. Why don’t we do it quicker? In 24 hours, sit down with lawyers present. Let’s have it as soon as possible for the benefit of everyone.”According to The Times of London, when the news broke in February, Nick de Marco, King’s Counsel, one of Britain’s leading sports lawyers, believes the huge number of charges means the case is likely to be a drawn-out affair.He added that it could “take up to four years”.Regardless of what happens, Guardiola, who has a contract until 2025, has no plans to leave the club.“I will stay next season while there are 110 breaches against us,” he said.“I would like to continue here next season independent of the result (of the Champions League final). I don’t know what it’s going to feel like winning or losing, but my feeling is I have a contract and I want to respect the club.”City face Inter Milan in the Champions League final on June 10 after they take on rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup final on June 3.

He is currently the CFO of OxPay Financial.In a bourse filing on Saturday, OxPay Financial said Mr Ng has been notified by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) that it believes he has committed offences under the Securities and Futures Act 2001 while he was employed as Tee International’s CFO.The offences fall under Section 203 and Section 331 of the Act. Mr Ng was Tee International’s CFO from Nov 10, 2020, to Aug 18, 2021.While no charges have been brought against Mr Ng as at Saturday, the company said that he will be placed under arrest and released on bail. He will also be required to surrender his passport.OxPay Financial’s board said it understands that Mr Ng was interviewed by the CAD on Oct 27, 2022, and May 11, 2023.The company’s nominating committee also noted that the potential offences relate to issues of late disclosure of information by Tee International and do not “at this time suggest an adverse finding on the character and integrity” of Mr Ng.It added that the issue does not compromise Mr Ng’s capabilities as the company’s CFO, and that his arrest may not necessarily lead to charges being brought against him.As an additional safeguard, any transactions or settlement to be undertaken by OxPay Financial and subject to Mr Ng’s approval will be reviewed and jointly approved by the company’s managing director, Mr Koh Jin Kit, or someone suitable appointed by the board.In February 2022, Singapore Exchange Regulation issued a regulatory announcement on Tee International’s lack of prompt disclosure over letters of demand and claims for overdue trade-related payables that it and its subsidiaries had received.These claims amounted to approximately $38.8 million at the time of the announcement and accounted for more than or equal to 10 per cent of the group’s net asset value and cash and cash-equivalent balances.Shares of OxPay Financial closed flat at 8.5 cents on Friday.

ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUIClaire HuangUPDATED Dec 02, 2024, 03:15 PMThanks for sharing!SINGAPORE – A legislative framework that lets banks share customer information was given the green light by Parliament on Tuesday, adding to Singapore’s arsenal against financial crimes. Amendments to the Financial Services and Markets Bill lay the groundwork for the first centralised digital platform that will allow financial institutions to request and share targeted information on individuals and companies confidentially to help flag, detect and prevent money laundering, terrorism financing and proliferation financing. The platform, known as Cosmic – short for Collaborative Sharing of Money Laundering/Terrorism Financing Information and Cases – will be initially opened to six banks when it is rolled out from the second half of 2024. The banks, which will also help develop the platform with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), are Citibank, DBS, HSBC, OCBC, Standard Chartered and UOB.Cosmic will first focus on three key risks – shell companies that conceal true ownership, trade-based cross-border transactions that disguise crime proceeds, and shell companies that facilitate indirect trade and payments to sanctioned countries. The initiative will be expanded to include more financial institutions and key risks down the road.Minister of State for Trade and Industry Alvin Tan told Parliament on Tuesday that the MAS is the owner of Cosmic and will ensure that data is exchanged and stored securely. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch up on the news that everyone’s talking about\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The platform will have robust controls, including cyber-security measures such as data encryption, and firewalls to block unauthorised external access. It will also have strict user access limitations. These controls will be subject to periodic audits to ensure the efficacy,” he said.No red-flag indicators will be triggered for most customers, Mr Tan assured the House, adding that the amendments have legal and operational safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the information being shared and the interests of legitimate customers.The changes to the law passed on Tuesday allow banks to share information when they detect suspicious transactions that meet a stipulated threshold. They can also request information from other banks and warn financial institutions of possible bad actors. In the first phase, information sharing will be on a voluntary basis before becoming mandatory.DBS head of legal and compliance Lam Chee Kin said criminals are getting more sophisticated and tend to engage with each bank differently to make it very difficult for any one institution to weed out illegal schemes alone. Cosmic provides banks with additional tools to bridge this information asymmetry, he added.Ms Loretta Yuen, head of group legal and compliance at OCBC, said information sharing on Cosmic is integrated into the bank’s data analytics tools, adding to its risk detection strengths and expertise.She also said it will encourage more efficient allocation of industry resources.  “Cosmic allows participant banks to leverage the economies of scale and tactical advantages gained from having a banking sector that can effectively share risk information in a timely manner, with a united purpose to combat financial crime.”More on this Topic‘Cosmic’ platform mooted for financial institutions to share details on suspicious customers Banks to share information voluntarily in initial phase of proposed platform to fight money laundering To protect legitimate customers, financial institutions have to assess a client’s profile before sharing details, consider other information sources beyond Cosmic, and give customers an opportunity to explain the suspicious behaviours observed. “We will only use the data for the purpose of detecting any illicit activities related to financial crime,” said UOB head of group compliance Daniel Ng, adding that the banks are committed to protecting the security of customer data. Currently, the United States and Britain have laws that allow such data sharing under the US Patriot Act and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.Given the clandestine nature of money-laundering, it is tough to estimate the total amount of money that gets laundered. But the United Nations office on drugs and crime has estimated that the amount of money laundered globally is about 2 per cent to 5 per cent of global gross domestic product, or roughly US$2 trillion (S$2.65 trillion).Describing the platform as “ground-breaking”, HSBC Singapore chief compliance officer Jamil Ahmed said the initiative “will place Singapore as a market leader in the global fight against financial crime”, while Citi Singapore country chief compliance officer Dylan Lee said the move will result in a safer banking environment for clients and bolster Singapore’s position as a financial centre.More on this TopicS'pore's central bank to launch new digital platform to fight illicit banking transactionsS’pore plans to amend laws to deal with money mules, who now often get off the hook\n\n\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Banks and financial institutionsMoney launderingFinancial crimesMAS/Monetary Authority of SingaporeSingapore ParliamentThanks for sharing!"}

Its shares plummeted more than 38 per cent, with trading in the stock halted multiple times.Share price swings did not reflect the fact that many regional banks outperformed on first-quarter earnings and had sound fundamentals, including stable deposits, sufficient capital and decreased uninsured deposits, the source said.“This week, we have seen that regional banks remain well capitalised,” the source added.Shares of regional banks resumed their slide this week after the collapse of First Republic Bank, the third United States mid-sized lender to fail in two months. Short-sellers raked in US$378.9 million (S$502 million) in paper profits on Thursday alone from betting against certain regional banks, according to analytics firm Ortex.Increased short-selling activity and volatility in shares have drawn increasing scrutiny by US officials and regulators in recent days, given strong fundamentals in the sector and sufficient capital levels, said the source.“State and federal regulators and officials are increasingly attentive to the possibility of market manipulation regarding banking equities,” the source said.\rWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration was closely watching the situation.“The administration is going to closely monitor the market developments, including the short-selling pressures on healthy banks. I would have to refer you to the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) on any possible actions,” Ms Jean-Pierre told a White House briefing. US SEC chairman Gary Gensler on Thursday said the agency would go after any form of misconduct that might threaten investors or markets.“As I have said, in times of increased volatility and uncertainty, the SEC is particularly focused on identifying and prosecuting any form of misconduct that might threaten investors, capital formation or the markets more broadly,” he said in a written statement.Ms Lindsey Johnson, president and chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association, stressed that the banking industry remained strong and urged policymakers to call out “unethical behaviour by activist investors” who were taking advantage of market volatility.“This volatility is being fuelled by emotion and misinformation that do not reflect the strong underlying fundamentals of our banks,” Ms Johnson said in a statement. “These institutions remain resilient and well capitalised, and Americans can rest assured their deposits are safe.”More on this TopicUS stocks down as First Republic's plunge sparks bank fearsUS stocks fall as regional banking concerns returnShort-selling, in which investors sell borrowed securities and aim to buy these back at a lower price to pocket the difference, is not illegal and considered part of a healthy market.

Now, it’s time to face the musicSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, faces 13 fraud charges.PHOTO: AFPUPDATED Nov 22, 2024, 10:27 AMThanks for sharing!SAN FRANCISCO – Faking it is over. That’s the feeling in Silicon Valley, along with some schadenfreude and a pinch of paranoia. Not only has funding dried up for cash-burning start-ups over the past year, but now, fraud is also in the air, as investors scrutinise start-up claims more closely and a tech downturn reveals who has been taking the industry’s “fake it till you make it” ethos too far.\rTake what happened in the past two weeks: Charlie Javice, the founder of the financial aid start-up Frank, was arrested, accused of falsifying customer data. A jury found Rishi Shah, a co-founder of the advertising software start-up Outcome Health, guilty of defrauding customers and investors. And a judge ordered Elizabeth Holmes, the founder who defrauded investors at her blood testing start-up Theranos, to begin an 11-year prison sentence on April 27.Those developments follow the February arrests of Carlos Watson, the founder of Ozy Media, and Christopher Kirchner, the founder of software company Slync, both accused of defrauding investors. Still to come is the fraud trial of Manish Lachwani, a co-founder of the software start-up HeadSpin, set to begin in May, and that of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, who faces 13 fraud charges later in 2023.When the money dries upTaken together, the chorus of charges, convictions and sentences have created a feeling that the start-up world’s fast and loose fakery actually has consequences.Despite this generation’s many high-profile scandals (Uber, WeWork) and downfalls (Juicero), few start-up founders, aside from Holmes, ever faced criminal charges for pushing the boundaries of business puffery as they disrupted us into the future.\rThe funding downturn may be to blame. Unethical behaviour can largely be overlooked when times are good, as they were for tech start-ups in the 2010s. \rBetween 2012 and 2021, funding to tech start-ups in the United States jumped eightfold to US$344 billion (S$458 billion), according to PitchBook, which tracks start-ups. More than 1,200 of them are considered “unicorns” worth US$1 billion or more on paper.\rBut when the easy money dries up, everyone parrots the Warren Buffett proverb about finding out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.\rAfter FTX filed for bankruptcy in November, Mr Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, updated the adage for millennial tech founders: “It feels like we were in a nightclub and the lights just turned on,” he tweeted.In the past, the venture capital investors who backed start-ups were reluctant to pursue legal action when they were duped. The companies were small, with few assets to recover, and going after a founder would hurt the investors’ reputations.\rMore money at stakeThat has changed as the unicorns have soared, attracting billions in funding, and as larger, more traditional investors including hedge funds, corporate investors and mutual funds have entered the investing game.“There is more money at stake, so it just changes the calculus,” said Mr Alexander Dyck, a professor of finance at the University of Toronto who specialises in corporate governance.\rThe Justice Department has also been urging prosecutors to “be bold” in its pursuit of more business frauds, including at private start-ups. Thus, charges for founders of Frank, Ozy Media, Slync and HeadSpin and expectations of more to come.\rMore on this TopicBankrupt crypto exchange FTX has recovered over $9b in assetsFTX failure rooted in ‘hubris’ and ‘greed’, debtors report findsIRL, a messaging app that investors valued at US$1 billion, is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly misleading investors about how many users it had, according to reporting from The Information.\rRumby, a laundry delivery start-up in Ohio, allegedly fabricated a story of financial success to secure funding, which its founder used to buy himself a US$1.7 million home, according to a lawsuit from one of its investors.\rNews outlets have also reported unethical behaviour at start-ups, including Olive, a US$4 billion health care software start-up, and Nate, an e-commerce start-up claiming to use artificial intelligence. A spokesperson for Olive said the company has “disputed and denied” the reported allegations.\rThe victim that got dupedAll of this creates an awkward moment for venture capital investors.When start-up valuations were soaring, they were seen as visionary kingmakers. It was easy enough to convince the world, and the investors in their funds – pension funds, college endowments and wealthy individuals – that they were responsible stewards of capital with the unique skills required to predict the future and find the next Steve Jobs to build it.\rBut as more start-up frauds are revealed, these titans of industry are playing a different role in lawsuits, bankruptcy filings and court testimonies: the victim that got duped.\rMr Alfred Lin, an investor at Sequoia Capital, a top Silicon Valley firm that put US$150 million into FTX, reflected on the cryptocurrency disaster at a start-up event in January.\r“It’s not that we made the investment. It’s the year-and-a-half working relationship afterwards that I still didn’t see it,” he said. “That is difficult.”\r‘Machiavellian narcissists’Venture capital investors say their asset class is among the riskiest places to park money but holds the potential for outsize rewards. The start-up world celebrates failures, and if you’re not failing, you’re viewed as not taking enough risks. But it is unclear whether that defence will hold as the scandals become more humiliating for everyone involved.\rInvestors are increasingly asking consultants like RHR International to help identify the telltale signs of “Machiavellian narcissists” who are more likely to commit fraud, said Ms Eden Abrahams, a partner at the firm. \rMore on this TopicFTX's Bankman-Fried pleads not guilty to campaign finance, China bribery charges Binance isn’t FTX. It’s much bigger and more systemically important to crypto “They want to tighten up the protocols around how they’re assessing founders,” she said. “We had a series of events which should be prompting reflections.”\rStart-ups have many of the conditions most associated with fraud, Professor Dyck said. They tend to employ novel business models, their founders often have significant control and their backers do not always enforce strict oversight.\rIt is a situation that’s ripe for bending the rules when a downturn hits. \r“It’s not surprising we’re seeing a lot of frauds being committed in the last 18 months are coming to light right now,” he said.

The report is the first released by FTX debtors since Sam Bankman-Fried’s digital asset empire rapidly collapsed into bankruptcy last November, with billions of dollars in customer funds lost. At the root of FTX’s spectacular collapse was “hubris, incompetence and greed” on the part of Bankman-Fried and top executives, including former engineering director Nishad Singh and former chief technology officer Gary Wang, the report said. “Despite the public image it sought to create of a responsible business, the FTX Group was tightly controlled by a small group of individuals who showed little interest in instituting an appropriate oversight or control framework,” said the report. “These individuals stifled dissent, commingled and misused corporate and customer funds, lied to third parties about their business, joked internally about their tendency to lose track of millions of dollars in assets, and thereby caused the FTX Group to collapse as swiftly as it had grown.” When FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the company did not even have a complete list of who its employees were, according to the report. “We are releasing the first report in the spirit of transparency that we promised since the beginning of the Chapter 11 process,” FTX’s new chief executive and chief restructuring officer John Ray III said in a press release.  The debtors said they reviewed more than one million documents and analysed the cryptocurrency firm’s available financial records and electronic devices, as well as interviewed 19 employees, as they put together the overview of FTX’s control failures. Digital assets worth more than US$1.4 billion (S$1.9 billion) have been recovered and secured in cold storage, the debtors said in the report. They added that an additional US$1.7 billion has been identified and is in the process of being recovered. Despite asset levels of billions of dollars and enormous transaction volumes, FTX “lacked fundamental financial and accounting controls”, the report said. “Reconstruction of the debtors’ balance sheets is an ongoing, bottom-up exercise that continues to require significant effort by professionals,” it added. Bankman-Fried faces trial in October after pleading not guilty to fraud and campaign-finance law charges. Singh pleaded guilty in February to fraud as part of a cooperation deal with prosecutors.

The four board directors taken to task are: former independent director and chairman Kushairi Zaidel, former independent directors John Ong Chin Chuan and Seet Chor Hoon, and former non-independent non-executive director Ong Sing Huat.The reprimand for the five came from the SGX Listings Disciplinary Committee (LDC) in connection with two transactions.The first involved the disposal of nine million shares in GCM Resources through Magnus Energy’s wholly owned subsidiary, MEG Global Ventures.\rThe LDC said Magnus Energy’s announcements in March and June 2017 failed to disclose relevant key details, including the fact that the disposal was related to the GCM Resources shares, the identity of the counterparty, the number of GCM Resources shares sold, as well as the aggregate value of the disposal consideration.\rFurther, another announcement in October 2018 disclosed contradictory information about whether the GCM Resources shares had been sold, or if the sale was ongoing, with the shares held in trust by a trading firm.In a resolution agreement submitted to the LDC, Mr Ho and the former board admitted to failing to ensure that the company had in place a robust and effective system of internal controls on matters concerning the transaction.The second transaction in breach of listing rules involved the acquisition of a convertible loan from Revenue Anchor pursuant to a deed of assignment between Revenue Anchor and MEG Global Ventures.\rRevenue Anchor, as the lender to GCM Resources for an outstanding convertible loan of £510,000 (S$844,000), was to assign to MEG Global Ventures the benefits of the convertible loan. This included the right to convert the outstanding balance of the convertible loan into shares in GCM Resources.The funds raised from the convertible loan was for GCM Resources to fund its major asset, the Phulbari coal mine project in Bangladesh.In this case, Mr Ho and the former board admitted to failing to ensure that the company disclosed that a condition precedent for the deed – that of obtaining consent from GCM Resources for the assignment of debt – had not been met.Among other things, the five also failed to ensure the company disclosed that GCM Resources lacked the requisite regulatory permits to commence coal production at the Phulbari coal mine.It was necessary for the board to disclose these details to avoid the establishment of a false market in the company’s securities, SGX said.\rApart from the reprimand, the LDC has also required Mr Ho to provide a signed written undertaking to SGX that he would not seek directorship on the board of directors, or a role as a key executive officer of issuers whose securities are listed on the SGX for two years from March 13, 2023.More on this TopicCompanies must restore free float if delisting conditions not met; Boustead Projects no exceptionSpate of delistings from SGX due to low liquidity and poor valuations, stakeholders sayThe four members of the former board have been asked to provide signed written undertakings to SGX that they would not seek directorships on the board of directors, or key executive roles in SGX-listed companies for a year.Magnus Energy was one of the companies linked to penny stock crash mastermind John Soh Chee Wen.\rSoh was linked to Mid-Continent Equipment Group, an oil industry equipment supplier – majority-held by Magnus Energy – that was the subject of a share-manipulation scheme.

A promoter group is defined as an entity that has a large shareholding in a listed company and can influence company policy.Transactions between such entities have to be disclosed in regulatory and public filings, and require shareholder approval above a specified threshold. Violations are typically punished with monetary fines.An e-mail to Sebi requesting comment was not answered. Sebi chairman Madhabi Puri Buch declined to comment on the Adani investigations at a news conference on Wednesday.An Adani Group spokesman said Mr Vinod Adani is a member of the Adani family and is part of the promoter group, but he does not hold any managerial position in any of the listed Adani entities or their subsidiaries.“This fact, like all other material information required to be reported, has been disclosed to the regulatory authorities in the past and also as and when required,” the spokesman added, without commenting on the regulatory probe into offshore entities.Mr Vinod Adani could not be reached for comment. Requests for comment sent to his holding company in Dubai, Adani Global Investment DMCC, were not responded to.The probe comes after United States short-seller Hindenburg Research’s Jan 24 report alleging improper use of tax havens and stock manipulation by the Adani Group, among other things – charges it has denied.Hindenburg’s report eroded more than US$100 billion (S$133 billion) in the value of shares in the Adani group of companies.India’s Supreme Court asked Sebi in March to investigate the Adani Group for any lapses related to public shareholding, related party rules or regulatory disclosures.Sebi’s investigation into Adani’s possible related party transactions with offshore entities with links to Mr Vinod Adani has not been reported before.While Sebi investigations are continuing, top regulatory officials are due to give a status report to a court-appointed panel on Sunday, the two sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as investigations are private.More on this TopicShort-seller Hindenburg that went after Adani says new report coming soonAdani stocks erase $8.5 billion of market value,  group seeks more time to repay loans Hindenburg in its January report alleged that Mr Vinod Adani’s entities have collectively moved “billions of dollars” into Adani’s publicly listed and private entities, often without required disclosure of the related party nature of the deals. In a 413-page response to the allegations, the Adani Group said all transactions entered into with entities who qualify as “related parties” under Indian laws and accounting standards have been duly disclosed.The three offshore entities with links to Mr Vinod Adani being probed for related party transactions are Mauritius-based Krunal Trade and Investment, Gardenia Trade and Investment, and Electrogen Infra in Dubai. There was no response from Krunal, Gardenia and Electrogen Infra to e-mails requesting comment.While the sources said that other similar transactions are also under regulatory examination, Reuters could not ascertain the names of other entities and their possible violation of related party transaction rules. Sebi suspects there were “disclosure violations” on some of those transactions, said one of the two sources. If proven, it could lead to monetary penalties and the matter may be referred to India’s Ministry of Corporate Affairs for transactions that are beyond SEBI jurisdiction, the source said.

In February, South Korean officials were looking for Kwon in Serbia. The pair were arrested on Thursday as they tried to fly to Dubai using falsified travel documents.The collapse of Terraform’s TerraUSD stablecoin shook the crypto world last spring. Meant to keep a constant value of US$1 via a complex mix of algorithms and trader incentives involving its free-floating sister token Luna, Terra was designed as a refuge from the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. But both Luna and Terra unravelled when confidence in Kwon’s project evaporated during a few chaotic days in early May 2022.Kwon’s whereabouts were the source of constant speculation since September, when South Korean authorities issued a warrant for his arrest on allegations including breaches of capital-markets law. Before last week’s arrest, Mr Adzic said his ministry had information that the two people could be in the country.“Upon further inspection, we found other passports, a forged Belgium passport and a South Korean passport in another name,” he said. \rThe authorities also seized three laptops and five mobile phones, according to the minister. Mr Adzic declined to comment on their content, apart from saying that “we found (a) significant amount of information that is very interesting”.Do Kwon is being held in standard medical quarantine in Montenegro, a local prison official said in a separate interview earlier on Tuesday.\rKwon will remain there to rule out Covid-19 infection till April 3 and can be visited only by his lawyer or doctor, said Mr Rade Vojvodic, the head of Montenegro correctional facilities.The 31-year-old is in good health and has not made any special requests, he said. The facility is located in Spuz, a small town just north of the capital Podgorica.The two are now under investigative detention that lasts up to 30 days. As they were apprehended in possession of several passports under different names, such detention was ordered “to formally assess their identity”, Mr Vojvodic said.

This will give them time to get familiar with using the Collaborative Sharing of Money Laundering/Terrorism Financing Information and Cases (Cosmic) platform. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said the platform will also need time to reach operational stability.A Bill to amend the Financial Services and Markets Act to set up Cosmic and set out rules governing its initial phase was put up for first reading in Parliament by Minister of State for Trade and Industry Alvin Tan on Monday. “During this voluntary phase, MAS will be closely engaging the participant financial institutions to understand and address any operational concerns, and make adjustments to the platform or requirements, as necessary,” the authority said in response to queries from The Straits Times.MAS earlier said, in a brief released on Monday, that it plans to make some aspects of information sharing mandatory and progressively extend Cosmic’s coverage to more areas and financial institutions in subsequent phases.Jointly developed by MAS and six major banks in Singapore, Cosmic will allow enrolled institutions to request and share information on customers whose banking habits raise multiple red flags pointing to possible criminal activities.The six banks – DBS, OCBC, UOB, Standard Chartered, Citibank and HSBC – will be the first to use Cosmic, which aims to thwart financial criminals who avoid detection through an ever-shifting web of accounts.Cosmic will operate alongside existing requirements for all financial institutions to have robust controls to detect and prevent suspicious activity, as well as report such activity to the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office of the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD), said MAS. The proposed platform will initially focus on three key risks in commercial banking: abuse of shell companies; misuse of trade finance for illicit purposes; and financing that supports the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In a consultation paper issued in October 2021 on Cosmic, these areas were identified as priority targets, in line with Singapore’s national strategy to fight serious financial crime.The thresholds and red flags for suspicious banking behaviour will be based on past global and domestic cases in the key risk areas, but will remain confidential to prevent tipping off offenders.More on this TopicMan involved in scams where over $5 million was lost allegedly paid others to give up bank accounts S’pore plans to amend laws to deal with money mules, who now often get off the hookThe red flags could include signs of a fictitious company profile, financial transactions without a clear economic purpose such as “round tripping” funds back to the sender, inconsistent replies to queries, or seemingly unrelated companies that actually have the same beneficial owners doing business with each other. The thresholds will be adjusted over time as criminals’ methods evolve, MAS said in the consultation paper.The six banks have said the new platform lets them collaborate on detecting illicit activity quicker and help preserve Singapore’s position as a global financial centre. “DBS is currently integrating its technology platform and operational processes with Cosmic, and is excited with the new capability to improve – in a very controlled way – information sharing between banks, regulators and law enforcement,” said Mr Lam Chee Kin, managing director and head of legal and compliance at DBS. Sophisticated criminals use a variety of ways to conceal information to and between banks to impair investigations, and no single bank can unravel the whole scheme, he added. “So Cosmic, in facilitating controlled information sharing, helps to mitigate one of the weapons the criminal has.”A Standard Chartered spokesman said Cosmic and the regulatory framework enabling it will serve as an important platform to strengthen the financial crime detection capabilities of all industry players here.“Together, financial institutions can collaborate and share information on specific transactions, and support MAS and CAD to detect and intervene in illicit networks operating in the financial system and more effectively combat financial crimes.” More on this TopicTrio allegedly helped scammers in money laundering activities involving over $5.4mSingapore man linked to scams that duped over 50 victims of $3.7m arrested in Malaysia\n\n\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.MAS/Monetary Authority of SingaporeBanks and financial institutionsFinancial crimesThanks for sharing!"}

He and his financial adviser, Je Kin Ming, were charged with conspiracy, wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering. The indictment follows a lawsuit earlier in the day by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The offerings, starting in April 2020, allegedly raised “at least hundreds of millions of dollars” from investors in the United States and elsewhere, the regulator said in its suit. Guo, a Chinese businessman living in exile in the US, and Je, also known as William Je, misappropriated a large share of the funds to enrich themselves and their families, according to the SEC’s lawsuit. Guo was behind three unregistered securities offerings for GTV Media Group and another to buy a crypto security called H-Coin that he falsely said was backed by gold reserves, according to the complaint.Guo, who is an associate of Steve Bannon, has been a vocal critic of the Communist Party of China. Fearing retribution from the regime, he sought political asylum in the US in 2017. A lawyer who represents Guo in other cases did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment on the suit. Bannon was one of the chief strategists behind Mr Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 US presidential election.

His Terraform Labs created the TerraUSD stablecoin, which was meant to have a constant US$1 value via a complex mix of algorithms and trader incentives involving a sister token, Luna. Their combined value soared past US$60 billion (S$81 billion), until confidence in the ecosystem evaporated in May 2022, prompting investors to flee and leaving the tokens almost worthless. Kwon’s whereabouts became unclear four months later after South Korea issued an arrest warrant on allegations including breaches of capital markets law. He denied any wrongdoing and tweeted that he is not “on the run”. But he is also the subject of an Interpol red notice. 1. Who is Do Kwon?Kwon, 31, left Stanford University in 2015 with a computer science degree, according to his LinkedIn profile. He had stints at Apple and Microsoft before, as he puts it, falling “down the crypto rabbit hole”. Kwon co-founded Terraform Labs in 2018, one of many young coders who saw blockchain technology as a gateway to financial revolution. His project of creating a stable digital currency outside of mainstream finance and regulators wooed a legion of followers, but also critics who said it was a doomed Ponzi scheme. At times brash and combative, Kwon trolled naysayers online, telling one critic that the Luna community was not as “poor as your broke ass”. In May 2022, as his project imploded, he said he was “heartbroken about the pain my invention has brought on all of you”. He has poked fun at people who see him as an absconder, saying he has not gone running in a while and needs to “cut some calories”.2. What happened to the TerraUSD stablecoin?TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin, and its sister token Luna collapsed in May 2022 after swelling in value during a pandemic-era crypto boom. TerraUSD was not backed by dollars or other assets, but instead was supposed to be worth US$1 because it could be redeemed for US$1 worth of Luna, which in turn was meant to increase in value as the Terraform Labs network became more valuable. TerraUSD grew in popularity when Kwon started the Anchor Protocol, which offered an eye-popping 20 per cent interest rate on TerraUSD deposits. But the whole edifice crumbled when investor confidence disappeared amid a sell-off in virtual coins. On May 7, 2022, TerraUSD’s peg began buckling when its price dropped to 99 US cents. Terraform Labs dramatically raised the supply of Luna to restore the link, causing the latter’s price to sink. (It was once worth more than US$100.) A Bitcoin reserve worth a few billion dollars failed to stem the spiral: In a matter of days, TerraUSD and Luna were practically valueless.3. How did Kwon end up a fugitive?TerraUSD’s implosion shook digital tokens globally, exacerbating a US$2 trillion wipe-out in crypto market value from a November 2021 peak. That drew the scrutiny of regulators from the United States to Asia, as well as law enforcement in South Korea, where roughly 280,000 people had bought Luna. Lawyers for Luna investors filed complaints with South Korean prosecutors alleging Kwon had engaged in fraud and illegal fund raising. On Sept 14 2022, prosecutors said an arrest warrant had been issued for Kwon and five others on charges including breaches of capital markets law. Kwon was thought to be in Singapore, but the city state on Sept 17 said he was no longer there. Prosecutors on Sept 26 said Interpol had issued a red notice – a request for police worldwide to locate and arrest Kwon, who has also been stripped of his South Korean passport. In February 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission accused Kwon and Terraform Labs of fraud. Singapore police this week said they had begun an investigation in relation to the company.4. What is Kwon’s defense?Kwon’s Terraform Labs rejected the South Korean charges, saying the case against him had become “highly politicised”. The company’s spokesman said prosecutors were acting unfairly and that there was no reasonable basis for accusing Kwon of breaching the nation’s Capital Markets Act because Luna does not qualify as a security under that rubric. Whether Luna is subject to securities law is a key issue in the case and echoes a wider question officials globally are asking about the status of digital tokens. The company denied Kwon was on the run and said he was in contact via lawyers with the agencies that had asked to speak with him. It did not respond to a request for comment about the Singapore police probe.5. What are the wider implications for crypto?The Terra fallout likely presages regulations for stablecoins to try to better protect buyers. Investors are also more wary of decentralised finance, or DeFi, which refers to the practice of trading, borrowing and lending tokens on digital ledgers like the one Kwon built. In the US, legislation has been drafted that would ban algorithmic stablecoins such as TerraUSD for two years. In South Korea, the nation’s ardour for digital assets has cooled. More broadly, the losses from Terra have heaped pressure on crypto investors to better assess risk.

Ng’s lawyers said in a filing early on Saturday to a federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, that the 50-year-old native of Malaysia has suffered enough, having spent six months in a Malaysian prison and four years alone under house arrest in the United States. “He was incarcerated under brutal and cruel conditions in a Malaysian prison for over six months before being picked up by the US authorities,” the lawyers said. “There can be no doubt that Mr Ng has suffered and has been punished every day since the day of his arrest.” They asked the judge to sentence him to time served and allow him to return to Malaysia, where he faces additional criminal charges.\rNg was convicted by a federal jury in April of three felony counts, including conspiring to violate US anti-bribery laws and to launder money. He faces a statutory maximum prison term of as long as 30 years but federal courts typically impose far shorter sentences. US District Judge Margo Brodie has scheduled Ng’s sentencing for March 9.  Prosecutors said Ng received millions of dollars in kickbacks from three bond deals that Goldman arranged for 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. The bank paid over US$2.9 billion (S$3.9 billion), the largest penalty of its kind in US history, and over US$5 billion globally, for its role in the scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet exclusive insights on Malaysia weekly\n\nThank you!\n\nSign up\n\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. \n\n\n Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's \n SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n marketing and promotions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust as he did at trial, in Ng’s 78-page sentencing memo, he and his lawyer Marc Agnifilo hotly contested the government’s charges against him. He argued that he did not play a leadership role in the scheme, insisting that colleague Tim Leissner got the 1MDB deal done because he alone lied to Goldman’s compliance about his interactions with corrupt Malaysian and Abu Dhabi officials.“Mr Ng’s role in the offence was minimal, and the only claim to the contrary was provided by Tim Leissner, who was patently incredible,” Ng’s lawyers wrote. They noted that Ng’s family paid back all the alleged 1MDB funds, plus additional money not related to 1MDB, “virtually the totality of the family’s combined wealth over generations”.In a memo to the court, Ng disputed some of the government’s assertions, arguing that the total amount of bribes paid in the scheme was US$1.1 billion, while US court officials said in a memo to Ng’s sentencing judge that it was about US$2 billion. Meanwhile, prosecutors in the office of Brooklyn US Attorney Breon Peace said earlier in February that it has been “able to definitively trace” US$1.6 billion from the 1MDB bond deals in bribe payments to foreign government officials. Prosecutors will recommend a sentence to the judge in a filing later.Leissner, who pleaded guilty and was the government’s star witness against Ng, is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept 6.

Others, including banks and counterparties, became uncomfortable at times with the group’s trading activities, according to several sources who either worked at the group or did business with it.In 2022, India’s federal police announced it was investigating allegations of fraud against Mr Gupta himself.Mr Ian Milne, a former commodity trade finance executive at Rabobank and HSBC Holdings who worked at TransAsia for two years in 2018 to 2020 trying to recover debts from Mr Gupta’s companies, said he “had to rub my eyes a couple of times” when he saw the news last week.“It’s very well known in the market that these guys have a highly dubious reputation,” Mr Milne said in an interview. “Most people haven’t dealt with them for many years.”Trafigura’s losses have shocked the commodity trading world, demonstrating that even one of the largest companies is not able to avoid the blow-ups and risks that have plagued the industry in recent years, and raising questions about the whole sector’s risk management.Trafigura said that it began investigating after identifying a number of red flags.\r“This was a systematic fraud perpetrated after a long and legitimate business relationship dating back to 2015 that involved misrepresentation and widespread falsification of primary and supporting documentation,” a spokesman for the company said. “Any fraud is an opportunity to review and tighten systems and procedures and a thorough review is under way.”Mr Gupta was born in 1979 into a commodity trading family. His father Vijay was a steel trader who represented Brazilian and Spanish companies importing iron and steel products into India in the 1980s and 1990s. When his father died in 2009, Mr Gupta took over the running of the family company, Mumbai-based Ushdev International, with his mother Suman as chair.At its peak in the early 2010s, the company had a market capitalisation of about US$250 million.In person, Mr Gupta is charming and rarely flustered, say several people who have done business with him. “He has a very laid-back style. Whatever the problem is, he’ll say it’s not really a problem, it’s all going to be solved,” said Mr Milne, who now works for MonetaGo, which builds technology to help banks and others avoid trade-finance frauds.Over the years, Ushdev branched out into developing wind power assets, but it still focused on metal trading. Mr Gupta added entities in Singapore, Malaysia, Dubai, Britain and Switzerland, including TMT Metals and companies under the banner of UD Trading Group.More on this TopicTrafigura traders enjoy 247% share price gain after record yearTrafigura says it will not take on any new oil and gas business in RussiaIn a 2011 interview published by Indiainfoline.com, he described his business as India’s third-largest metal trading company and said it had been doubling in size over the previous years.\r“The metal business is back-to-back business,” he said. “We don’t face any kind of downside.”For some in the industry, the Gupta companies’ trading activity raised question marks, said sources familiar with the matter. The companies would sometimes buy and sell large volumes of metal for little apparent commercial purpose, some of the sources said.Mr Jonas Rey, chief executive of Athena Intelligence, a corporate intelligence company in Geneva that provides support to trade finance entities, said he investigated entities, including TMT, on behalf of several clients.“We provided intel to multiple clients on TMT’s involvement in what we called a carousel fraud,” he said. “You have one cargo in the middle, you create 10 companies around it, and they sell the cargo to one another. One cargo gets financed 10 times. It’s like financial musical chairs. Eventually everything comes crashing down.”Several companies came to regret their dealings with Mr Gupta. Gunvor was left with exposure to Ushdev in the tens of millions of dollars when it got into financial trouble, according to company filings and sources familiar with the matter. The exposure led to a relatively small loss for Gunvor as it made an insurance claim. Still, it was a blow that coincided with Gunvor’s decision to close its metal-trading desk in 2016.TransAsia is still embroiled in legal disputes with Gupta companies over alleged unpaid debts linked to its financing of trade in metals, including copper. In one instance that has been made public in Singapore courts, the trade finance fund claims that Mr Gupta’s UD Trading Group Holding owes it US$63 million. In July 2022, India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said it had opened an investigation into Mr Gupta and his mother, as well as Ushdev, over alleged fraud after a complaint made by the State Bank of India. The CBI said it had conducted searches in three locations which had led to the “recovery of incriminating documents/articles”.For Trafigura, the saga will raise difficult questions over how it vets its business partners.\r“The post-mortem will probably be ruthless internally,” said Mr Jean-Francois Lambert, a consultant and former trade finance banker. “Traders and risk management will be challenged.” BLOOMBERGMore on this TopicSingapore-headquartered Trafigura has no immediate plans to exit Russian oil projectGoldman Sachs traders reaped over $3.9 billion in commodities boom\n\n\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.Commodity marketFraudFinancial crimesThanks for sharing!"}

In a pattern that accelerated during the isolation of the coronavirus pandemic, romance scams claimed US$139 million (S$184 million) from Americans aged 60 and older in 2020, up from US$84 million the year before. In one of the more alarming episodes of what has become a leading type of fraud aimed at older Americans, a Holocaust survivor was swindled out of his life savings of nearly US$3 million, according to a federal indictment unsealed in New York recently. How love scams work Alone at home as Covid-19 spread in the summer of 2020, another victim, Ms Kate Kleinert, decided to accept a Facebook friend request from a handsome stranger. He described himself as a Norwegian doctor working in Iraq and called himself Tony. After a couple of months of daily communication on encrypted messaging apps, Tony began asking for money. By December 2020, Ms Kleinert, 69, had given Tony and two people claiming to be his children some US$39,000 in gift cards. The scam devoured Ms Kleinert’s savings, her late husband’s life insurance, her pension and her income from Social Security, leaving her destitute.The retiree went to the local police and then the state police. She was told there was nothing they could do. “The loss that hurts the most is losing his love and losing the family that I thought I was going to have,” she said.Her scammer followed a typical playbook, experts said: claiming to be a professional working abroad, exploiting a victim’s loneliness to quickly establish a bond, building an imagined future with them, and then planning an in-person meeting that depended on the victim’s willingness to part with money.“I’ve seen elders mortgage their houses, borrow large sums of money from their neighbours, empty out their retirement accounts,” said lawyer Michael Delaney. “It is absolutely astonishing to me how much money someone can get out of an elderly person’s account before anyone really notices and puts a stop to it.”Why older people are targeted While young people are more likely to fall victim to online scams overall, older people are more susceptible to romance scams. The reason, experts say, is simple: They usually have more money.Peaches Stergo, the woman charged with wire fraud in the federal case involving the Holocaust survivor, extracted some US$2.8 million from the victim, an 87-year-old Manhattan man whom she met on a dating website. Federal prosecutors said she used some of the money to pay for a condominium in Florida, rooms at the Ritz-Carlton, gold bars, a Corvette and luxury watches and clothing.The median loss from a romance scam for people aged 70 and older in 2021 was US$9,000, against US$2,400 across all age groups.“When older adults lose money, they lose more money because they have more money to lose,” said Ms Amy Nofziger, director of fraud victim support for the AARP, an advocacy group for people over 50. The FBI has sounded the alarm about romance scams. In 2021, the bureau said, Americans of all age groups coughed up more than US$1 billion to con artists, up from more than US$362 million in 2018.Are dating sites liable?Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act gives online platforms, including dating sites and apps, immunity from liability for content posted by their users. The Federal Trade Commission sued Match Group in 2019, alleging that the company, which runs online dating platforms like Match.com, Tinder and Hinge, was allowing fraudsters to disguise themselves as normal daters. A federal court in Texas dismissed the claims last year, citing Section 230. Still, in recognition of the problem, Match Group rolled out a public awareness campaign in January alerting users to red flags.While Section 230 makes it hard to sue online platforms over the content they host, individuals can be held legally liable if they willingly become part of a conspiracy to defraud.Glenda Seim, an 81-year-old Missouri woman, was sentenced in 2022 to five years of probation after pleading guilty to two federal felonies. She admitted that she had acted as a “money mule” on behalf of an online love interest, a man claiming to be an American working in Nigeria in need of money to return home. She pawned electronics sent to her home and set up fraudulent bank accounts, ignoring federal agents who told her that she was being scammed. More on this TopicCan you spot a scam? Find out how well you know 6 common scams in S'poreInteractive: How a love scammer's 3-month ruse to swindle $165k got exposedWhat victims can do Seim’s reluctance to accept that her online romance was not real is common among older victims of this variety of fraud, Mr Delaney said. “Despite showing incontrovertible evidence that the person they think they’re in love with isn’t who they say they are and the money isn’t being used for what they say it’s being used for, they will defend that exploiter through anything,” he said. Usually, he added, one of the victim’s grown children must step in to put a stop to it. This is what happened in the wire fraud case involving the Holocaust survivor in New York. By the time the victim confided in his son, the 62 cheques he had written over the course of four years had been cashed.Still, investigators were able to arrest Stergo – an unusual result in Internet love scams, where perpetrators are rarely found and losses are almost never recoverable. While there is little recourse for recovering funds that in most cases have already been spent, a family member’s involvement can often halt a scam before it goes any further. In instances where older people refuse to accept that they have been victims of a scam, family members can file an emergency petition for temporary guardianship and ask a judge to issue an order that will immediately freeze bank accounts. As Ms Kleinert found, there is little that law enforcement can do to track down online scammers, particularly those operating from foreign IP addresses.After losing all of her money, she turned to the young people in her life to tighten her online privacy settings. But after a fire destroyed her home and a friend set up a GoFundMe page to help her, she found she was still vulnerable. After months of silence, she said, Tony got back in touch to ask for more money.“‘I know you have money,’” she said he told her. “‘I saw your GoFundMe page.’”“That sent a chill down my spine,” she said.

The settlement marks its first crackdown on staking.It could have a sweeping impact on the industry because major crypto exchanges, including those run by Coinbase Global and Binance Holdings, have waded into the products to diversify revenues. Staking works by letting users generate yields in return for allowing their tokens to be used to facilitate transactions on a blockchain. In the case of the yields offered by Kraken, they could be as high as 21 per cent, according to the SEC’s complaint. A report from Kraken estimated the global value of staked assets at US$42 billion as at the end of 2022.A Kraken representative said in a statement the firm will end its staking services only for US clients. These customers will be “unstaked” and those outside the US will receive staking services from a separate Kraken subsidiary. Kraken did not admit to or deny the SEC’s allegations in its settlement. Over the past 1½ years, SEC chairman Gary Gensler has argued that many crypto assets are really just unregistered securities trading on the blockchain. He has said firms must follow the agency’s tough trading and investment rules or face the consequences. He has repeatedly warned trading platforms that he plans to hold them accountable. “Today’s action should make clear to the marketplace that staking-as-a-service providers must register and provide full, fair and truthful disclosure and investor protection,” Mr Gensler said in a statement.Staking services have gathered steam in recent months after Ethereum – the biggest commercial highway in crypto – switched over to the so-called proof-of-stake method of ordering blockchain transactions in September 2022. Mr Francesco Melpignano, chief executive officer of Kadena Eco, which is a unit of a company that built a proof-of-work blockchain, said the settlement could be “strictly negative in the sense that US residents may be banned from staking, even natively, on a blockchain altogether”.San Francisco-based Kraken is a top cryptocurrency exchange, with a daily trading volume of roughly US$650 million globally, according to CoinMarketCap. The Internal Revenue Service, which in a separate filing asked a court to compel Kraken to turn over its books and other data, said the exchange had failed to comply with a previous summons issued in 2021.Last August, Coinbase disclosed that it was being probed by the SEC over its staking programmes. The exchange is the second-largest depositor of staked Ether, according to tracker Etherscan. Lido Finance, a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform, is the largest.Mr Henry Elder, head of DeFi at Wave Financial, said the case was a “huge gift to decentralised staking providers like Lido, RocketPool and StakeWise”. As apps like Lido and RocketPool are decentralised, meaning that no single company runs them, they might be harder for regulators to control, he added. Republican SEC commissioner Hester Peirce disagreed with the commission’s Democratic majority, calling for the agency to regulate by issuing guidance on staking, instead of speaking “through an enforcement action”.“A paternalistic and lazy regulator settles on a solution like the one in this settlement,” he wrote in a dissent.

KPMG is reviewing JPMorgan’s oversight of traders across the bank’s markets division globally, the people said. The bank’s revenues from the buying and selling of bonds, currencies and stocks rose to US$29 billion (S$38 billion) in 2022, the largest among the top five United States banks and a near record high.Market volatility surged at the start of the pandemic and investment banks and securities firms have seen trading activity soar, adding to the challenge of supervising employees amid increased volumes of buying and selling and large price swings.The CBOE Volatility Index, a measure of market volatility, remains above its pre-pandemic levels.JPMorgan, when asked by Reuters why it had hired KPMG, said: “We invest heavily in our compliance and surveillance systems and often engage third parties to benchmark our capabilities.”It added: “Such practices should not be taken for anything more than that.” A spokesman for KPMG in London declined to comment.Warnings and alertsCompliance teams at investment banks that oversee traders rely in part on warnings and alerts from automated systems to catch and prevent potential misconduct, which if undetected could result in costly losses for the banks and draw scrutiny from regulators.In 2020, JPMorgan agreed to pay a penalty of US$920 million for market manipulation at its trading desks in New York, London and Hong Kong and entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice.Under the agreement, which ends this year, the bank committed to enhance its compliance efforts and to report fixes to its oversight, the Justice Department said.As part of their obligations to regulators, banks must report suspicious transactions to watchdogs when there are reasonable grounds to suspect ill intent, such as potential insider dealing or market manipulation.When market prices move sharply and trading volumes surge, the automated systems that banks use to monitor trading can produce an avalanche of warnings of unusual activity, making it harder for supervisors to detect potential conduct breaches.One such event was in September 2022, when radical tax-cutting plans from then British Prime Minister Liz Truss caused turmoil in the British government bond market. The volatility in British government bonds, known as gilts, triggered a flood of compliance alerts from JPMorgan’s traders, one of the sources said.More on this TopicNew kid on the block EFG goes toe-to-toe with big boys in Asia-Pac wealth managementCredit Suisse well on the recovery path following huge losses, says chairman Axel LehmannBritain’s borrowing costs posted the biggest jump in decades, forcing the Bank of England to step in with an emergency package to calm the markets. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said conditions in gilt trading at the time were abnormal.    KPMG has done an analysis of the technology that the financial industry is using to supervise trading and is now advising JPMorgan on how to adapt its systems, a second source said.    Some changes are already being tested, reducing the number of alerts to compliance departments in some areas of trading, the first source said.    In 2021, the number of so-called suspicious transaction and order reports that financial services firms flagged to Britain’s finance watchdog – the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) – increased by 15 per cent from the previous year, the regulator said in its latest available data. Possible insider trading appeared to be the most frequent threat, the FCA data shows.

In that case, prosecutors may be willing to budge on what sentencing recommendations – the time they believe Bankman-Fried should spend in prison – they submit to a judge, or drop one or more charges.“Even if you have a strong evidential case going to trial, it does carry some risks,” Dr Jennings said. “If the case is going to take weeks, it does take a very serious commitment of government resources. So the government, in general, is always open to reaching some agreement if it avoids the cost of trial.”Pleading not guilty also opens up discovery channels. Bankman-Fried and his legal team, led by defence attorney Mark S. Cohen, will get a better insight into what evidence prosecutors have, including any exculpatory material.US Attorney Damian Williams previously revealed that the government had spoken to dozens of FTX employees and had tens of thousands of pages of material, including e-mails, financial statements and Signal messages.The government’s star witnesses are some of Bankman-Fried’s closest associates – former Alameda Research chief executive Caroline Ellison and FTX chief technology officer Gary Wang. They have pleaded guilty to fraud charges in cooperation agreements carved out with the government while Bankman-Fried was still in the Bahamas.While negotiating a plea is one thing, Bankman-Fried’s overall value as cooperator is somewhat diminished by the fact he is at the top of the FTX hierarchy. More on this TopicBankman-Fried’s parents have received physical threats since FTX collapsedBankman-Fried met White House aides on crypto policy before FTX collapse Even if Bankman-Fried wanted to cooperate, the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) would agree to do so only if he brought substantial value, defence attorney Tim Howard, a former SDNY prosecutor, said. “SDNY does not like to cooperate down, and Bankman-Fried is likely at the top of their pyramid, so it’s unlikely.”Only a fraction of criminal cases in the US end up going to trial.The FTX founder was arrested in the Bahamas on Dec 12 after US prosecutors filed an indictment accusing him of spearheading a years-long fraud through the cryptocurrency exchange.Bankman-Fried fraudulently raised US$1.8 billion (S$2.4 billion) from investors under the guise of FTX having appropriate controls and risk management measures, the authorities allege.

In media interviews before his arrest, Bankman-Fried conceded being a poor manager, with lapses in oversight, but denied knowingly committing fraud.He was extradited to the US in December and released from custody on a US$250 million bail package.

PHOTOS: ST FILE, GAVIN FOOGrace LeongUPDATED Nov 25, 2024, 05:15 PMThanks for sharing!SINGAPORE - The mastermind behind Singapore’s biggest case of stock market manipulation was sentenced to 36 years in jail on Wednesday, which lawyers say is the longest custodial sentence for the offence to date in Singapore. The scam wiped out $7.8 billion in market value in October 2013, leading to the unprecedented jail term for mastermind John Soh Chee Wen. His co-conspirator, Quah Su-Ling, was handed a 20-year jail term.  The High Court granted Soh, 62, and Quah, 58, a stay on the execution of their sentences after their lawyers said they will file an appeal by the end of Wednesday. But Soh, a Malaysian, will not appeal against his conviction on three charges of being involved in the management of Blumont Group, Asiasons Capital and LionGold Corp – known collectively as BAL – while being an undischarged bankrupt. Soh and Quah are guilty of manipulating the share prices of BAL between August 2012 and October 2013.In delivering the sentences on Wednesday, High Court judge Hoo Sheau Peng noted: “The accused persons perpetrated a scheme of substantial scale, complexity and sophistication. Armed with a good understanding of the securities and financial markets, and tapping on their extensive connections and networks, they boldly exploited the system. “They personally minded and tended to the intricate scheme they devised on an almost daily basis for a prolonged period of 14 months, taking steps to evade detection by the authorities. They did so for financial gains. Even after the scheme failed, (Soh) continued to subvert justice and conceal what they had done.“It is necessary and of utmost importance for the substantial global sentences to be imposed on (Soh and Quah) respectively to capture the gravity of their wrongdoing.” The two were convicted of a record 349 successful charges in total following nearly 200 days of trial over nearly four years.Soh has been in remand since Nov 25, 2016, while Quah, the former chief executive of Ipco (now renamed Renaissance United) is out on $4 million bail, which has been extended pending her appeal. On Wednesday, Quah’s bailor, who was dressed in a black top and white shorts, was reprimanded by Judge Hoo for her inappropriate attire, and told “not to appear in shorts in future” in the courtroom. Soh and Quah were found to have manipulated the share prices of BAL between August 2012 and October 2013 through 187 trading accounts held with 20 financial institutions in the names of 58 individuals and companies.  They used contra trading in multiple accounts to “roll-over” or extend their position in the market repeatedly over the 14-month period – week after week, month after month, the prosecution said. These “roll-over” trades were done to create artificial liquidity in the market for these shares, and allow them to retain control of the shares without having to make payment for them. By generating artificial liquidity, the pair had hoped the shares would enter market indices and attract genuine trades in BAL. They wanted to use the shares to fund BAL’s corporate deals. More on this TopicPenny stock crash timeline: John Soh and Quah Su-Ling’s marathon trial comes to a close Scheme behind 2013 penny stock crash was elaborate and highly exploitative: High CourtThey also kept the price of the shares on an upward trend, to grow the market capitalisation of BAL over time, enabling them to reap profits, and avoid sustained contra losses that would otherwise cripple their scheme, the prosecution said. But around the end of September 2013, following several adverse news reports on BAL, Soh called a meeting with brokers at the LionGold office, touted the prospects of BAL and sought to persuade them to buy BAL to support the price. As selling pressure continued to mount in the early days of October 2013, Soh and Quah then sought to support the price of BAL shares by using the controlled accounts to buy up shares.  But this failed, and the prices of the stocks crashed, wiping out $7.8 billion in market capital. Of the 180 charges on which Soh was convicted, prosecutors sought consecutive sentences for 11 charges (three of false trading, three of deception, two of cheating and three of witness tampering) and an aggregate sentence of 40 years’ jail. For Quah, who was convicted on 169 charges, the prosecution sought consecutive sentences for six charges (two of false trading, three of deception and one of cheating), and an aggregate sentence of 19½ years’ jail.Mr Robson Lee, a senior corporate finance lawyer, noted that the “heavy sentences reflect the severity of the conduct of the two convicted accused”, and the jail terms are “unprecedented in scale and would certainly be the longest custodial period in the history of Singapore for market manipulation”. “This is a landmark case and underscores the robustness of our law enforcement against market manipulative conduct,” Mr Lee said. Ms Loo Siew Yee, assistant managing director for policy payments and financial crime at the Monetary Authority of Singapore, noted that the duo’s “elaborate scheme to manipulate shares listed on SGX led to large losses by investors and harmed public confidence in the integrity of Singapore’s capital markets”. “The successful prosecution and stiff sentences leave no doubt as to the authorities’ resolve in acting against such misconduct.”  More on this TopicS'pore's penny stock crash masterminds convicted: How the saga wiped out $8 billionMarket rigger John Soh called involvement with Quah Su-Ling a '10-year-old infrastructure'Join ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.Penny stocks crashStock marketSingapore companiesSingapore stocksSingapore courtsFinancial crimesThanks for sharing!"}

FTX pledged to segregate customer accounts but instead allowed them to be misappropriated, and therefore customers should be repaid first, according to the lawsuit filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.   “Customer class members should not have to stand in line along with secured or general unsecured creditors in these bankruptcy proceedings just to share in the diminished estate assets of the FTX Group and Alameda,” said the complaint.\rBahamas-based FTX halted withdrawals in November and filed for bankruptcy as customers rushed to pull their holdings from what was once the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, after questions surfaced about its finances.Bankman-Fried faces charges stemming from what a federal prosecutor called a “fraud of epic proportions” that included allegedly using customer funds to support his Alameda Research crypto trading platform.\rBankman-Fried has acknowledged risk-management failures at FTX but said he does not believe he has criminal liability. He has not yet entered a plea and was released on a US$250 million (S$337 million) bond last week that included restrictions on his travel.The proposed customer class, which wants to represent more than a million FTX customers in the US and abroad, seeks a declaration from the court that funds held in FTX US accounts for US customers and in FTX Trading accounts for non-US customers or other traceable customer assets are not FTX property. It also wants the court to find specifically that property held at Alameda that is traceable to customers is not Alameda property, according to the complaint.If the court determines it is FTX property, then the customers seek a ruling that they have a priority right to repayment over other creditors.Crypto companies are lightly regulated and often based outside the US, and deposits are not guaranteed as US bank and brokerage deposits are, complicating the question of whether the company or customers own the deposits.

The transactions were documented in a series of promissory notes, detailed in an affidavit that surfaced in a dispute in the United States Bankruptcy Court in New Jersey on Tuesday. The Robinhood stake – about 56 million shares in total – is at the centre of a multi-jurisdictional ownership fight playing out in Antigua, New Jersey and Delaware. Collapsed crypto exchange FTX, bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi and an individual FTX creditor are all trying to establish claims to the shares in separate legal proceedings. BlockFi is suing Emergent Fidelity Technologies, the corporate entity that owns the Robinhood shares, for control of those shares, claiming they back a loan made to FTX’s sister firm Alameda Research. FTX lawyers have said former Alameda chief executive Caroline Ellison pledged the shares to BlockFi just before FTX’s collapse. Alameda’s borrowing from FTX is at the core of the fraud case against Bankman-Fried unfolding in Manhattan federal court. It is unclear if the funds at issue in the bankruptcy dispute originated with FTX. Bankman-Fried attested to the loans in an affidavit submitted to a judge in Antigua earlier in December, where Emergent Fidelity has been placed in insolvency proceedings. Lawyers for the company submitted the affidavit to BlockFi’s bankruptcy judge on Tuesday.In his affidavit, Bankman-Fried said the US$546 million in loans from Alameda were “capitalised into” Emergent Fidelity. Bankman-Fried owns 90 per cent of Emergent Fidelity and Wang owns the rest.The company then purchased 56 million shares in Robinhood, according to the affidavit. Bankman-Fried originally filed the affidavit in Antigua on Dec 12, the day of his arrest. He was seeking to wrest control of Emergent Fidelity from court-appointed liquidators on the island.It is one of several battles Bankman-Fried is facing, following the collapse of FTX in November. The 30-year-old is currently on bail and living in California after Manhattan prosecutors charged him with orchestrating a years-long fraud involving billions of dollars of customer funds.Ellison, who pleaded guilty to fraud offences in a deal with federal prosecutors, signed off on the loan to Bankman-Fried and Wang, the court papers show. Wang has also flipped on Bankman-Fried and cut a deal with prosecutors.Separately, US investigators are probing an alleged cybercrime that drained more than US$370 million out of FTX just hours after the crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy last month.The Department of Justice has launched a criminal probe into the stolen assets that is separate from the fraud case against Bankman-Fried, according to a person familiar with the case. US authorities have managed to freeze some of the stolen funds, the person confirmed. However, the frozen assets represent only a fraction of the entire loot. It is unclear whether the infiltration was an inside job, as Bankman-Fried suggested in interviews before his arrest, or the work of an opportunistic hacker keen to exploit the vulnerabilities of a crumbling company. The conduct could amount to a charge in connection with computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

Their sworn statements offer a preview of how two of Bankman-Fried’s former associates might testify at trial against him as prosecution witnesses.In a separate plea hearing on Dec 19, Wang said he was directed to make changes to FTX’s code to give Alameda special privileges on the trading platform, while being aware that others were telling investors and customers that Alameda had no such privileges.    Wang did not specify who gave him those directions. Mr Nicolas Roos, a prosecutor, said in court last Thursday that Bankman-Fried’s trial would include evidence from “multiple cooperating witnesses”. He added that Bankman-Fried carried out a “fraud of epic proportions” that led to the loss of billions of dollars of customer and investor funds. Bankman-Fried has acknowledged risk-management failures at FTX, but said he does not believe he has criminal liability. He has not yet entered a plea.He founded FTX in 2019 and rode a boom in the values of Bitcoin and other digital assets to become a billionaire several times over as well as an influential donor to US political campaigns.A flurry of customer withdrawals in early November amid concerns about commingling of FTX funds with Alameda prompted FTX to declare bankruptcy on Nov 11.Bankman-Fried, 30, was released last Thursday on a US$250 million (S$337 million) bond. His spokesman declined to comment on Ellison’s and Wang’s statements.Ellison told the court that when investors in June 2022 recalled loans they had made to Alameda, she agreed with others to borrow billions of dollars in FTX customer funds to repay them, understanding that customers were not aware of the arrangement.\r“I am truly sorry for what I did,” Ellison said, adding that she is helping to recover customer assets.\rMore on this TopicHow did FTX founder Bankman-Fried secure $340m bond, among largest in US history?Visionaries or charlatans: The many faces of crypto downfallsWang also said he knew what he was doing was wrong.\rThe transcript of Ellison’s hearing was initially sealed out of concern that the disclosure of her cooperation could thwart prosecutors’ efforts to extradite Bankman-Fried from the Bahamas, where he lived and where FTX was based, court records showed.Bankman-Fried was arrested in the capital Nassau on Dec 12 and arrived in the US last Wednesday after consenting to extradition.A magistrate judge ordered him confined to his parents’ California home until trial.\rLast Friday evening, Judge Abrams recused herself from the case, saying in a court order that the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, where her husband is a partner, advised FTX in 2021.

Bankman-Fried was expected to appear in federal court in Manhattan on Thursday. “Let me reiterate a call I made last week,” Mr Williams said. “If you participated in misconduct at FTX or Alameda, now is the time to get ahead of it. We are moving quickly and our patience is not eternal.” The SEC alleged that Ellison, the former chief executive of Alameda Research, and Wang, a co-founder of FTX, participated in a multi-year scheme to defraud FTX investors. Between 2019 and 2022, Ellison – at the direction of Bankman-Fried – manipulated the price of FTX’s native token FTT by purchasing large quantities in the open market, according to the SEC complaint. The agency also alleged that Ellison and Wang knew or should have known that Bankman-Fried was falsely touting FTX as a safe crypto trading platform, while at the same time improperly transferring customer funds from FTX to Alameda. The SEC said Ellison and Wang are cooperating with its ongoing investigation into other potential individuals or entities tied to the misconduct at FTX. CFTC’s lawsuit, which also alleges fraud, accused Ellison of directing Alameda to use billions of dollars of FTX funds, including customer funds, for trades on other crypto exchanges and to pay for high-risk investments. According to a CFTC news release, Wang – also the former chief technology officer of the firm – “created features in the code underlying the FTX trading platform that allowed Alameda to maintain an essentially unlimited line of credit on FTX”.  The guilty pleas and cooperation agreements are a major advance in the criminal fraud case against Bankman-Fried. They could push other former executives to cooperate with the authorities in the case against Bankman-Fried, who has been charged with fraud, money laundering and campaign finance offences, and could face decades in prison. US prosecutors and regulators have said Bankman-Fried carried out a fraud that diverted billions in customer money for other uses, including buying real estate in the Bahamas, trading crypto at Alameda, making campaign donations, and investing in other crypto companies. They contend that he defrauded customers, investors and lenders to his crypto trading firm before it collapsed in bankruptcy in November. The charges also come as a major blow to the crypto industry, which has been reeling for the past year as prices of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have plunged and firms have filed for bankruptcy.

Bankman-Fried was arrested last week in his US$30 million (S$40.5 million) penthouse by the Bahamian authorities at the request of US officials.  Since being denied bail at an initial Bahamas court hearing last week, Bankman-Fried was held in a correctional facility on the outskirts of Nassau, commonly known as Fox Hill.The notorious prison is a far cry from the luxury property where he had lived after setting up FTX’s headquarters in the Bahamas.Once back in the US, he is likely to be arraigned within hours and his lawyers may present a case for him being granted bail. It was not immediately clear at which American airport Bankman-Fried would land.US prosecutors in Manhattan last week charged the 30-year-old cryptocurrency mogul with stealing billions of dollars in FTX customer assets to plug losses at his hedge fund, Alameda Research, in what US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams called “one of the biggest financial frauds in American history”. Bankman-Fried earlier left the courthouse, surrounded by guards with assault weapons, and entered a vehicle, according to Reuters. The Bahamas’ Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that the Foreign Minister had signed off on allowing Bankman-Fried’s extradition to the United States. Bankman-Fried decided to agree to extradition in part out of a “desire to make the relevant customers whole”, according to an affidavit read in court on Wednesday and dated Dec 20.Dressed in a suit, he stepped up to the witness box in court, where he spoke clearly and steadily as he was sworn in.Bankman-Fried’s defence lawyer, Mr Jerone Roberts, said his client was “anxious to leave”.Judge Shaka Serville said he was satisfied that all legal requirements for extradition had been met and that Bankman-Fried had not been “forced, coerced or threatened” into making the decision.During Wednesday’s hearing, Mr Roberts requested that the “rule of speciality” be followed. This rule, which is in the Bahamas’ extradition treaty with the US, says a person can be tried only on the charges for which he is extradited.More on this TopicFTX ex-CEO sent back to Bahamian jail after catching lawyer off guard with US extradition planFTX was engaged in a massive, years-long fraud: US prosecutors  Bankman-Fried’s US-based defence lawyer, Mr Mark Cohen, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.

It ends the year slumped in an alleyway, robbed of its cocktail of cheap money and leveraged bets, shunned by the establishment.\rThe preeminent cryptocurrency has lost 60 per cent of its value, while the wider crypto market has shrunk by US$1.4 trillion (S$1.9 trillion), squashed by rising interest rates, vanishing risk appetite and corporate collapses including Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX.Crypto funds have seen net inflows of US$498 million in 2022, versus US$9.1 billion in 2021, according to data from digital asset manager CoinShares, reflecting how mainstream finance has steered clear of the market through its annus horribilis.\rMr James Malcolm, head of FX strategy at UBS, said in the first half of 2022 he spent 70 per cent of his time with clients talking crypto. By contrast, during 10 days in North America in November, from Montreal to Miami, “I spent less than 2 per cent of my time discussing crypto”.\rEven in 2021, before the decline began in November, cryptocurrencies were realistically seen as two or three years away from winning acceptance from mainstream institutional investors, Mr Malcolm added.\r“Now it’s completely in the far, distant future.”\rCrypto optimist for 2023?It hasn’t been all bad for crypto, though: 2022 was also the year the Ethereum blockchain finally pulled off its “Merge” mega-upgrade, which moved it to a less energy-intensive “proof of stake” system in September.“This event was a technological feat and one of the lone positive events in a year that otherwise has been rather dark for crypto,” said Mr Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of the Pastel Network blockchain.\r“These upgrades will make the Ethereum ecosystem far easier to use for people all around the world. Because of all this progress, it’s hard not to be a crypto optimist going into 2023,” he said.\rMr Ben McMillan, chief investment officer at IDX Digital Assets, said the rising popularity of blockchain-based tools, including decentralised exchanges and decentralised finance, had also been an important development in 2022.\r“So that is very bullish for the ecosystem and something to keep an eye on long-term,” he added. “We could see bigger allocations to digital assets once risk appetite resumes in 2023.”\rBitcoin meets recessionBitcoin hit a record high of US$69,000 in November 2021, with the crypto market touching US$3 trillion, buoyed by fiscal and monetary stimulus from countries around the world trying to ward off the economic damage from COVID lockdowns.But as societies reopened, surging inflation forced central banks to tighten rates and led to investors fleeing higher-risk assets: tech stocks and cryptocurrencies.\rBitcoin, long-heralded as a handy store of value in times of inflation because of its limited supply, flopped during the test, with investors turning to tried-and-tested havens such as the US dollar as rates went up. It fell by about a third in January, outpacing an 8 per cent fall for US stocks.\r“2022 was a new environment for digital assets. They’ve never been around in a recession or a rising-rates environment,” said Ms Katie Talati, director of research at digital asset firm Arca.\rMore on this Topic2022 saw a series of crypto meltdowns that is reshaping the industry  How two crypto hedge funds dodged the market collapseYear the bubble poppedAs investors pulled money from crypto, major projects came under strain.

Mr Ryan Salame, the former co-chief executive of FTX Digital Markets, told the regulators on Nov 9 that client assets were transferred to Alameda Research to “cover financial losses” at the trading firm, court filings show. Mr Salame further alleged that only three people had the ability to authorise such a transfer: Bankman-Fried, former engineering executive Nishad Singh, and FTX co-founder Gary Wang, according to the court filings. The Financial Times first reported on the contents of the documents. Mr Salame indicated to the executive director of the Securities Commission of the Bahamas on a conference call that “such transfers were not allowed and therefore may constitute misappropriation, theft, fraud or some other crime”, the filings show. The disclosure triggered an urgent request from the securities commission’s executive director Christina Rolle to the local commissioner of police for an investigation, according to e-mails included in the court filings.FTX experienced a bank run in the few days prior to Mr Salame approaching the Bahamian authorities, and it filed for bankruptcy on Nov 11. The filings show that during that pivotal pre-bankruptcy period, Bankman-Fried exchanged e-mails with several Bahamian officials, including Ms Rolle and Attorney-General Ryan Pinder. In one e-mail sent on the night of Nov 9, Bankman-Fried apologised to Mr Pinder for “delayed responses” to previous messages. In that e-mail, Bankman-Fried wrote “it’s been a hectic week but that’s on me. Myself, and Joe (cc’ed), will be responsive going forward”. Bankman-Fried’s father, Mr Joseph Bankman, was copied in the e-mail.  In the same message, Bankman-Fried wrote that FTX had “segregated funds for all Bahamian customers”, adding that “we would be more than happy to open up withdrawals for all Bahamian customers on FTX, so that they can, tomorrow, fully withdraw all of their assets, making them fully whole”.Bankman-Fried remains the only senior executive charged with any crimes and is facing extradition to the United States from the Bahamas. Several billion dollars’ worth of customer assets has disappeared, FTX’s new chief executive John Ray III testified before the US Congress on Wednesday. Some of the funds most likely went to Alameda, he said.Mr Salame did not return calls or messages seeking comment. Bankman-Fried is now in a Bahamas jail after being denied bail.

At Bankman-Fried’s first court appearance on Tuesday, his lawyer said he planned to fight extradition. But that was before the judge denied Bankman-Fried’s request to be released on US$250,000 (S$337,500) cash bail and a proposal to wear an ankle monitor to track his movements, and ordered him to be taken into custody at the Bahamas Department of Correctional Services facility, commonly known as Fox Hill. Despite its bucolic name, Fox Hill is known for overcrowding, poor nutrition, inadequate sanitation and substandard medical care, according to a 2020 US State Department report. The report described rat and maggot infestation and tiny cells with only buckets for toilets.People familiar with the matter said Bankman-Fried, 30, currently has his own room in the medical block of Fox Hill’s maximum security unit, where he will remain until his Feb 8 extradition hearing. One person said Bankman-Fried’s relatives called the prison on Tuesday night to ask whether vegan meals could be delivered to him. He cannot receive visitors due to Covid-19 curbs at the prison.It is a far cry from the luxury penthouse in Nassau’s exclusive Albany community from which Bankman-Fried ran FTX and, according to federal prosecutors in New York, orchestrated a years-long fraud that diverted billions of customer funds from the cryptocurrency exchange to personal use and risky bets by FTX’s sister trading firm, Alameda Research. Lawyers familiar with the extradition process said Bankman-Fried’s failure to win release on bail could change his calculations about returning to the US, especially since extradition battles can drag on for months or even years.\r“It would be tough for SBF to withstand that for any period of time,” said Mr Bruce Zagaris, a Washington-based lawyer. “He won’t get any special treatment from the inmates and the guards, like he did at the Albany condominium. Eventually, he’s going to say, ‘I don’t want to spend another few years at this place, what are my alternatives?’”Houston lawyer Douglas McNabb said losing a bail hearing often “causes defendants to rethink whether they want to appeal the case or not because they don’t want to be sitting in a Bahamian jail”. “That’s a decision he’s going to have to make.”Czech-born businessman Viktor Kozeny, who successfully fought extradition from the Bahamas on US bribery charges, was imprisoned for more than a year at Fox Hill before a judge granted him bail.The Bahamian prison “has its legacy and reputation of breaking even the toughest of men”, his lawyer said at the time.

The relationship between the two companies, and alleged misuse of FTX customer funds, led to criminal charges against founder Sam Bankman-Fried.Mr Singh, who was FTX’s engineering director, has not been charged with a crime. GitHub is a programming code repository used by firms and individual software developers to store and share code. It is frequently used to allow developers to work together. It was not immediately clear whether any other FTX employees had access to the account. The GitHub account bearing his name annotated the code snippets reviewed by Bloomberg with comments including “Korea KYC” and “BD expenses accounts”, the documentation showed.Alameda shunted debts, which soared to US$8 billion (S$10.8 billion), to an FTX customer account that was not easily identifiable as belonging to Alameda, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) alleged in a civil complaint on Tuesday. Bankman-Fried, who founded Alameda and FTX, called it “our Korean friend’s account” and directed it to be created at least partially to mask Alameda’s gaping liabilities, the CFTC alleged.The so-called Korean account enjoyed the same privileges as Alameda’s main account and sub-accounts, including exemptions from parts of FTX’s risk management policies, the lawsuit said. Mr Singh and representatives for Bankman-Fried and FTX did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bankman-Fried is being held without bail at a jail in the Bahamas as he awaits an extradition hearing in February.Though Alameda enjoyed virtually unlimited access to FTX customer funds for its own trading purposes since the exchange was created, the company began to spiral in May, after a US$60 billion crypto ecosystem built on tokens TerraUSD and Luna collapsed, and lenders demanded payments. That led Alameda to ramp up its use of FTX customer funds, regulators alleged. Do Kwon, a South Korean national who was behind TerraUSD, is reportedly in Serbia. A South Korean court issued an arrest warrant for him in September on allegations he violated capital markets laws.Months after the jarring round of margin calls began, Bankman-Fried contemplated closing down Alameda around September, according to the CFTC complaint. He drafted a Twitter thread to announce its closure, saying: “I feel really uncertain what’s right!” But Alameda never shut.Bankman-Fried was jailed on Tuesday after the US authorities brought eight criminal charges against him, including fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The US Securities and Exchange Commission also sued him.The CFTC complaint described the “Korean account” as a sub-account of Alameda that was not opened under an “alameda-research.com” identifier and not otherwise readily identifiable as being an Alameda-associated account.

The disgraced former crypto mogul faces a slew of investigations and class-action lawsuits aimed at him or the companies in his defunct empire. Mr Bankman-Fried, who hasn’t been charged with any crimes, has denied trying to perpetrate a fraud while admitting to grievous managerial errors at FTX. Mr Bankman-Fried has retained New York defense attorney Mark Cohen to represent him. Mr Cohen was previously part of the team that represented convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell.Mr Bankman-Fried has also been asked to testify before the House Financial Services Committee, with chairman Maxine Waters saying Wednesday that it’s “imperative” that he attend a Dec 13 hearing.FTX’s new chief executive officer John J.

United States prosecutors are said to be investigating Mr Bankman-Fried, the founder of collapsed crypto exchange FTX and its sister trading platform Alameda Research, regarding his possible involvement in orchestrating the death spiral of TerraUSD (UST) and its affiliated token Luna, according to a report in The New York Times citing people with knowledge of the matter. Separately, Bloomberg News reported that FTX’s new chief executive officer and bankruptcy lawyers met this week with Manhattan federal prosecutors investigating the failed exchange. The Terra ecosystem was helmed by the symbiotic relationship between the two tokens that was managed by lines of automated code to govern circulation. If the price of UST went above US$1, traders were incentivised to swap Luna for UST at a profit, and vice versa, thus in theory keeping UST’s circulation in check. But when investors lost confidence in one, the other went down too, and so they were locked in a so-called death spiral that saw their value plummet to near zero in a week’s time in May. \rWhose actions helped precipitate the decline has remained in question. There were two sides to this trade. The first is the side that traders can see on-chain, where wallet addresses were visibly swapping UST for other tokens, and that caused the market to start to panic. The other is on centralised exchanges’ order books, where the “who’s who” is harder to track because user information is not disclosed by platforms.On-chain mismatchIn early May, signs of unease about UST’s stability had begun to emerge. Anchor, a decentralised lending protocol on the Terra blockchain, reduced the yields it offered to clients to 18 per cent, implying that it had started to feel the brunt of offering unsustainable rates to traders willing to lock up their tokens. On May 7, UST’s issuer Terraform Labs withdrew US$150 million in UST liquidity from Curve, a platform that offered a pool where investors could swap UST for other stablecoins such as USDC at equal value. Do Kwon, Terraform’s founder, said this was a preparatory move ahead of deploying more cash into the pool in a week’s time. But one minute later, an unknown wallet swapped US$84 million in UST from the pool for USDC. And that wallet was not the only one swapping out their UST, with 12 others also moving tokens between May 7 and May 8, to the tune of US$321 million. Seven of those wallets had been withdrawing UST from Anchor as early as January, data analytics firm Nansen said, and as the stablecoin started to spiral in May, the main US$84 million perpetrator withdrew around US$193 million in UST from Anchor.Kwon inferred on Thursday on Twitter that Alameda had been involved in pushing down the value of UST. Suffice to say, all the moves in May imbalanced the Curve pool, which by that point had more UST than any of the other three tokens. Terraform’s Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) – a fund established to raise money for the sole purpose of keeping UST worth US$1 – leapt into action, removing US$100 million in UST from the pool. In order to do that, it had to sell Bitcoin it kept in reserves for exactly this purpose, a process that coupled with declining market sentiment, pushed the price of Bitcoin down by 29 per cent that week. This was taking place as LFG and Terraform Labs were already in fire-fighting mode, expending a lot of stored crypto cash in a bid to keep UST and Luna from dropping to zero. They were not successful either, with panic swapping and US$10 billion in withdrawals from Anchor making it impossible for the LFG to balance the scales. While most UST activity was happening on decentralised protocols like Anchor and Curve in May, there was also still a bit of action on centralised exchanges like Binance, FTX and others. The only problem was that as UST and Luna’s prices began to come under pressure, virtually all liquidity for UST on major exchanges evaporated.Data collated by blockchain analytics firm Kaiko at the time showed that on May 8, a huge round of “sell” orders appeared on Binance for a pair that would trade UST and another stablecoin, Tether’s USDT. On the same exchange, the “ask” side of UST’s order book increased, which would have made it really difficult for the token to repeg to the dollar. “Ultimately, the poor liquidity on centralised exchanges likely played a huge role in UST’s depegging, along with a series of events exacerbated by a rush of UST out of Anchor,” Kaiko’s Mr Riyad Carey wrote at the time.

But because the LFG was so focused on spending Bitcoin to help shore up UST on Anchor and Curve, there was relatively little left to match the massive sell wall that its price was facing on exchanges.\rThe bulk of those “sell” orders against UST appeared to be coming from Alameda, the person cited by The New York Times said.

The matter is part of a broadening inquiry into the collapse of Mr Bankman-Fried’s Bahamas-based cryptocurrency empire, and the potential misappropriation of billions of dollars in customer funds.Federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been examining whether FTX broke the law by transferring its customer funds to Alameda. A run on deposits in November exposed an US$8 billion (S$10.9 billion) hole in the exchange’s accounts, causing the company to collapse. Mr Bankman-Fried stepped down as FTX’s chief executive when the company filed for bankruptcy on Nov 11.FTX is also under investigation for violating US money-laundering laws that require money transfer businesses to know who their customers are and flag any potentially illegal activity to the law enforcement authorities, three people familiar with the investigation said. In a statement, Mr Bankman-Fried said he was “not aware of any market manipulation and certainly never intended to engage in market manipulation”.“To the best of my knowledge, all transactions were for investment or for hedging,” he added.\rRepresentatives of the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan declined to comment. Representatives of FTX did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The focus on possible market manipulation adds to the legal storm brewing around Mr Bankman-Fried. It is illegal for an individual to knowingly stage market activity designed to move the price of an asset up or down. US senators Sherrod Brown and Patrick Toomey are seeking testimony from Mr Bankman-Fried at a hearing about FTX’s collapse on Dec 14, according to a letter issued on Wednesday.Mr Brown said he and Mr Toomey are prepared to issue a subpoena if Mr Bankman-Fried does not choose to appear before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs hearing.“There are still significant unanswered questions about how client funds were misappropriated, how clients were blocked from withdrawing their own money, and how you orchestrated a cover-up,” Mr Brown’s letter to Mr Bankman-Fried said.The House Financial Services Committee is holding its own hearing on FTX on Dec 13; chairman Maxine Waters said on Twitter that Mr Bankman-Fried has been asked to testify, and a subpoena is “definitely on the table”.  NYTIMES , BLOOMBERG More on this TopicFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried hires Ghislaine Maxwell’s defence lawyerHow the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire has disrupted AIJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.CryptocurrenciesBankruptcy/LiquidationFinancial crimesUnited StatesThanks for sharing!"}

Such requests are often used to start tapping potential sources of information held by witnesses, investors or customers without seeking grand jury subpoenas.Attorneys from the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) enforcement division, which is running a parallel civil probe into the exchange operator’s collapse, sent similar requests for information to companies that invested in or traded on the crypto platform, people familiar with those inquiries said.The agency is seeking to learn more about the relationships those companies had with the former crypto giant, as well as communications with former top brass at FTX and Alameda, including Mr Bankman-Fried and Ms Ellison, the people said. The SEC is also trying to get a better sense of what FTX representatives told investors and whether any misrepresentations were made that would violate securities laws, the people said.  The moves show that the authorities are casting a wide net as they embark on their investigations into FTX’s collapse, examining what the company and its leaders told investors and customers as the exchange imploded last month. So far, the authorities have not accused anyone of wrongdoing.Representatives for New York prosecutors and the SEC declined to comment. FTX and Mr Sam Bankman-Fried did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Galaxy Digital chief executive officer Mike Novogratz, whose crypto financial services firm disclosed a US$76.8 million (S$104 million) exposure to FTX, acknowledged in a Bloomberg Television interview on Thursday that the authorities have been getting in touch with firms that had interactions with FTX. “Regulators have some egg on their face,” he said. “Sam was very far along at pitching to be the cash Bitcoin market here in the US, both with the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.”Separately, the US Justice Department’s bankruptcy watchdog is calling for an independent probe into the collapse of FTX Group, saying a neutral party should investigate the cryptocurrency empire’s downfall. The US Trustee, part of the Justice Department that oversees the bankruptcy court, has asked FTX’s bankruptcy judge to appoint an examiner in the company’s insolvency proceedings. The examiner would publish a public report on FTX’s implosion and look into allegations of wrongdoing. Examiners are sometimes appointed in large, contentious US bankruptcies when a judge deems them necessary. After Lehman Brothers went bust, for example, an examiner eventually published a report explaining what went wrong. An examiner is also looking into the downfall of crypto lender Celsius Network. While the company’s new management has done “valuable preliminary work” untangling FTX’s myriad problems, “the questions at stake here are simply too large and too important to be left to an internal investigation”, lawyers for the US Trustee said in court papers.

The firm’s failure has sparked investigations by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, focused on whether FTX misappropriated customer funds when it lent billions of dollars to Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund. Both firms were owned by Mr Sam Bankman-Fried, who gave up control of the companies at the time of the bankruptcy filing. The stunning collapse has left amateur investors and major firms scrambling to recover billions of dollars in cryptocurrencies that they deposited on the FTX platform. The bankruptcy process will determine how much of that money can be retrieved.\rBut more than a week into the legal process, Mr Bankman-Fried’s poor management of FTX has left lawyers with limited information about the firm’s finances, Mr Bromley said at the hearing. He said the company had faced cyber attacks, and that assets were still missing. He appeared to be referring to an apparent hack on the day the company filed for bankruptcy, which came to light when crypto researchers noticed the unauthorised movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in FTX assets.At the hearing, Mr Bromley presented a detailed account of FTX’s corporate history and its abrupt collapse this month. He said Mr Bankman-Fried had established a sprawling corporate empire, which was run as his “personal fiefdom”. But in the end, he said, “the emperor had no clothes”.Over the past two weeks, FTX has faced intense scrutiny over how it spent its money. One business entity involved in the bankruptcy, Mr Bromley said, bought almost US$300 million worth of real estate in the Bahamas.A key issue at the hearing was whether FTX would have to publicly disclose more detailed information about its creditors, a group that likely includes hundreds of thousands of ordinary people who deposited money in the exchange.US bankruptcy judge John Dorsey ruled that the information could stay private, at least for now. The judge also let the company keep secret details about the firms tracking down assets and those protecting the platform from cyber attacks. Normally, every major firm hired by a bankrupt company must be made public in a court filing.   Asset protection and recovery is one of the top objectives for the case, Mr Bromley said at the hearing. Maximising value is key for the process, whether it means selling or reorganising businesses, and FTX will likely ask the judge for permission to sell some assets “quite quickly”, he added. Meanwhile, Mr Bankman-Fried, who resigned as chief executive, has apologised to staff in a letter that outlined a crash in “collateral” to US$9 billion from US$60 billion. “I didn’t mean for any of this to happen, and I would give anything to be able to go back and do things over again,” he wrote in the message sent to employees on Tuesday and obtained by Bloomberg News.A slide in digital asset markets in spring roughly halved collateral to US$30 billion, while liabilities were US$2 billion, he said. A combination of a credit squeeze, a further sell-off in virtual coins and a “run on the bank” left collateral at US$9 billion ahead of FTX’s Nov 11 bankruptcy, he wrote. “I did not realise the full extent of the margin position, nor did I realise the magnitude of the risk posed by a hyper-correlated crash,” Mr Bankman-Fried said. He did not give exact details on the make-up of the collateral or the liabilities.

PHOTO: REUTERSPUBLISHED Nov 22, 2022, 07:17 AMThanks for sharing!New York – Long before Mr Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX cryptocurrency empire collapsed this month, it was already on the radar of US federal prosecutors.The US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York spent several months working on a sweeping examination of cryptocurrency platforms with United States and offshore arms, and had started poking into FTX’s massive exchange operations, according to people familiar with the investigation.The focus was on compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, the people said. The authorities have used the law, requiring financial institutions to take steps to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing, to go after crypto platforms that allegedly falsely claimed that they do not serve US customers. Bahamas-based FTX operated one of the world’s largest international crypto exchanges, as well as a separate and much more limited venue called FTX US that said it complies with the Act.It is unclear whether prosecutors in Manhattan reached any conclusion in their probe before FTX – valued at nearly US$32 billion (S$44.2 billion) in a January financing – collapsed, sending the crypto market into a dive and raising questions about the accuracy of its pledges to safeguard customer assets. This put the federal investigation into a new trajectory, the people said.The months-long sweep shows that FTX’s sprawling operations were raising questions even before billions of dollars in financial ties between the exchange operator and Mr Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research investment arm alarmed investors and led his empire to unravel.Prosecutors and regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are now seeking help from new FTX chief executive John Ray III, who took over as part of its bankruptcy proceedings and is navigating what he described as “a complete absence of trustworthy financial information”.Last week, Mr Ray told the bankruptcy court in a filing that his team had found loans of more than US$1 billion made by Alameda to Mr Bankman-Fried and other executives. The filing also alleged that software was used to conceal the use of customer funds. Whether any such conduct broke laws will be left to prosecutors. So far, they have not accused anyone of wrongdoing. The loss of customer funds at FTX means that the authorities will examine whether the exchange misled clients about how their assets would be held, former prosecutors said. To prove wire fraud, investigators would have to show someone at FTX did so for gain using a wire, such as a phone call, e-mail or text.The FTX bankruptcy case will aid prosecutors in figuring out what documents exist to subpoena. Investigators will also seek communications between employees, whether that is via e-mail, Slack, Signal or WhatsApp, as well as testimony from witnesses, said Mr Anand Sithian, a former federal prosecutor now at Crowell & Moring.     “What is going to be hard when you issue a subpoena to financial institutions is that it can take 30, 60, 90 days to process,” Mr Sithian said. “Here if you send a subpoena, I don’t know that the company, FTX, would have that ready. They might need to recreate that.” BLOOMBERGMore on this TopicWhat’s next in the FTX fallout?

FTX owes its 50 biggest unsecured creditors a total of US$3.1 billion.PHOTO: REUTERSPUBLISHED Nov 21, 2022, 10:49 AMThanks for sharing!NEW YORK – Mr Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire, FTX, was an epic mess and the unwinding is likely to last longer than the empire itself.Crypto companies, investors and government officials who heard policy pitches and pocketed political donations from the FTX founder, who is commonly known as SBF, are reeling. The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan said last Thursday that it was writing down a US$95 million (S$131 million) investment in FTX. Coinbase, the only publicly listed crypto exchange in the United States, has seen stock and bond prices fall as the digital asset industry struggles. Crypto values, which fell dramatically over the summer, have dropped further.FTX owes its 50 biggest unsecured creditors a total of US$3.1 billion, according to court papers filed on Saturday, and its new management has found just a fraction of the firm’s crypto assets.At this stage, there are many more questions than there are answers about what the reverberations of FTX’s collapse will look like. Here are three of the biggest:Who is next?Crypto companies are deeply intertwined – they invest in one another, buy one another’s tokens as well as lend tokens and capital to one another – which means the collapse of FTX could topple others.Crypto lender BlockFi, which signed a deal to be rescued by FTX when crypto prices nosedived over the summer, paused withdrawals last week and is preparing for a possible bankruptcy. BlockFi said it had “significant exposure” to the failed exchange and FTX’s trading arm, Alameda Research.\rIndustry insiders expect more companies to follow suit.Two restructuring advisers told DealBook that Oxygen, a decentralised finance lending and borrowing platform backed by Alameda, was on their watch lists. Oxygen’s token is OXY; its total market capitalisation, which was about US$395 million in January, has fallen to about US$2.6 million.Genesis Global Capital, one of the largest lenders in the crypto space, suspended withdrawals and new loans last Wednesday. Genesis, which may have lost as much as US$175 million in the FTX collapse, is struggling to pay back creditors.Genesis is connected to many other firms. Its parent, Digital Currency Group, owns publication CoinDesk and investment firm Grayscale, a substantial crypto holder, among other entities.More on this TopicCollapsed FTX owes nearly $4.3 billion to top 50 creditors: Court filingLunch with Sumiko: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin on FTX saga and crypto in SingaporeIs SBF going to prison? “That is the million-dollar question. Everything is on the table,” said Mr Joe Rotunda, director of the enforcement division of the Texas State Securities Board, which began investigating FTX before its collapse.The complexity of the international FTX empire, messy record-keeping, unreliable statements and the anonymous nature of transactions on the blockchain complicate matters for investigators and prosecutors building cases. They need to do forensic audits and resolve jurisdictional issues.\r“Bad investments don’t necessarily mean prison. The big one is fraud. That is the big hammer,” Mr Rotunda said. “Concealing or lying. Words and conduct. There is a duty to truthfully disclose.”Mr Sam Bankman-Fried also faces civil litigation from big backers and venture capitalists.PHOTO: NYTIMESMr Bankman-Fried also faces civil litigation from small investors as well as big backers and venture capitalists, who began developing strategy with lawyers even before the bankruptcy – and expect to face claims themselves from their limited partners.“The civil suits will come before the criminal suits,” said Mr Paul Foley, a securities law expert at the law firm Akerman. “Anyone who invested in FTX would have a lawsuit. But it is a lot more difficult to make a criminal case than a civil case.”Will the FTX collapse prompt more regulation?Congressional committees and government agencies in the US had already been investigating FTX or are now calling for inquiries. Last Friday, the House Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy sent a letter to FTX’s current and former chief executives requesting information on “the full scope of harm inflicted upon its investors”.The House Financial Services Committee (FSC) and the Senate Banking Committee have announced hearings on the FTX debacle, and are also likely to address new rules and a pending Bill. Stablecoins – cryptocurrencies ostensibly pegged to the value of a dollar – are the subject of legislation languishing in the FSC. The Bill, which would ensure that stablecoin issuers were overseen more as banks are, could get a renewed push.One complication is that, until recently, Mr Bankman-Fried did a lot of lobbying in Washington and was a champion of the legislation, testifying before the committee, wielding influence behind the scenes with congressional staff and publishing a related policy statement on Twitter.“Anything he has been pushing policywise will be reassessed,” said Mr Lee Reiners, a financial technology expert at Duke University Law School, who was formerly at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.      More on this TopicFTX collapse raises hard questions about the ‘effective altruism’ movement How FTX bought its way to become the ‘most regulated’ crypto exchangeAnother is that Mr Bankman-Fried was a major political donor, contributing around US$37 million to Democratic candidates in the last election cycle. His co-chief executive, Mr Ryan Salame, was a major Republican donor, giving more than US$20 million. In all, FTX executives contributed nearly US$72 million to both political parties, and the company was strategically bipartisan in its lobbying and government affairs hiring.Politicians on both sides of the aisle are regifting the funds. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (Democrat), who co-sponsored a crypto Bill that Mr Bankman-Fried supported, and Representative Kevin Hern (Republican) are among those who said they would donate the funds to charity.Regardless of the politics, the collapse of FTX is likely to spur action, and some crypto companies that see regulation as key to legitimacy would welcome it.

The spectacular flameout of his virtual empire has evolved from a cautionary tale into a masterclass on everything that is wrong with crypto markets.As customers and creditors sort through what remains of the failed exchange’s holdings, and as the repercussions spread throughout the crypto realm, here are four lessons that stand out:Beware of assets denominated in cryptoFTX was vulnerable not only because it was leveraged, but also because its assets were not really assets. Judging from the balance sheet that the company reportedly sent to potential rescuers, they consisted largely of notional digital tokens.Unlike stocks, bonds or commodities, they had no associated cash flows or practical uses. At best, they represented fee income from trading other similarly made-up tokens.\rThe same applies to just about all digital tokens, the primary “assets” of the exchanges and other intermediaries through which most people interact with crypto. They are pure speculative instruments.Something like them might someday prove useful as representations of traditional assets, or as assets in virtual worlds, but that is a distant prospect. As things stand, they are fundamentally worthless.Market capitalisation is not valueIf a company has 100 beads and sells one for US$1 million (S$1.37 million) – maybe to itself, maybe to someone to whom it lent the money, maybe to a true bead believer – it can say the beads have a market capitalisation of US$100 million. This is roughly how Mr Bankman-Fried came up with an estimate of more than US$10 billion for FTX’s holdings of digital tokens, including FTT, Serum and Solana.It also helps explain how the entire crypto market, at one point, achieved a supposed capitalisation of about US$3 trillion.\rClearly, those beads are not worth US$100 million. Attempting to sell them all might yield nothing. Anyone who accepted them as collateral might end up with nothing too.Accounting mattersCryptocurrencies on public blockchains are highly transparent: Everyone can see what belongs to whom at any time.Not so crypto intermediaries.

But given the lack of standardised rules, there is little to ensure their accuracy.What is really backing the stablecoin Tether remains uncertain, despite the issuer’s regular reports.Customers have no reliable way of knowing how leveraged big exchanges such as Binance might be, executives’ assurances notwithstanding.\rConsumer protections are essentialBillions of dollars in FTX customers’ funds have effectively gone missing, lost to a tangle of entities and at least one apparent hack.This was possible in part because FTX – with the exception of its US derivatives-trading subsidiary – operated in a regulatory vacuum, with none of the requirements governing capital, liquidity, segregation of funds, cyber security or conflicts of interest that traditional intermediaries must meet.The same is true of just about every intermediary in the crypto world. \rSometimes, the authorities take one-off actions, as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission have done in relation to false reporting, “wash” transactions and insider trading at Coinbase. But there is no “cop on the beat” making rules and enforcing compliance.Whatever the potential benefits of crypto, the surrounding speculative frenzy has little to do with them. On the contrary, it primarily serves to lure people in and separate them from their money, as FTX has now demonstrated. Proper regulation might help nudge crypto in a more useful direction, and is needed to ensure it does not present a threat to the broader financial system.Meanwhile, the message for investors and traditional finance remains simple: Stay away.

The sudden downfall of Mr Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX.com may have permanently damaged their prospects of being included in mainstream portfolios.While plenty of industry die-hards remain, many professional money managers are saying the case for crypto as a portfolio diversifier or digital gold has been debunked.\rThe losses are too great, and the market structure is too risky, they say. \r“What’s become clear is it will not find a home in institutional asset allocation,” said Mr Hani Redha, a multi-asset portfolio manager at Pinebridge Investments in London. “There was a period when it was being considered as a potential asset class that every investor should have in their strategic asset allocation and that’s off the table entirely.”  \rThe implosions and scandals of the past few months have laid waste to the key arguments of crypto boosters, and all but obliterated the notion of Bitcoin as safe haven in turbulent times.\rBut none of those events – from the TerraUSD collapse to the Celsius bankruptcy – were as damning as the revelation that even FTX, until recently considered one of the most blue-chip names in crypto, was unsound.The FTX collapse is “raising questions on the viability of the crypto ecosystem”, said Mr Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Fidelity International, which oversees US$646 billion (S$887 billion) from London. “It was always tough to make a case for including crypto, but the set up has come under more pressure.”\rHis firm launched a Bitcoin exchange-traded product in February, aimed at professional European investors. It has lost about 55 per cent since inception. \rJust a year ago, crypto mania was at its height.  Bitcoin had topped US$67,000. In January, Bridgewater estimated that 5 per cent of Bitcoin was held by institutional-level investors.\rFrothy predictions were everywhere back then.\rJPMorgan Chase & Co strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote Bitcoin could theoretically reach US$146,000 in the long-term by crowding out gold. A survey by PWC from April found that 42 per cent of crypto hedge funds were predicting Bitcoin to trade between US$75,000 and US$100,000 by the end of 2022. \rNow, the views among investors are more restrained.\rMr Panigirtzoglou said in a report this week that Bitcoin could revisit the summer lows of US$13,000. Bitcoin traded under US$17,000 on Friday. \r“The argument in investing in crypto as diversification died some time ago,” he said in an interview. \rBitcoin has crashed and recovered before. Some believers see hubris in the market is being flushed out, which will eventually put the industry on a path to maturity.\rMore on this Topic5 things to watch out for when dabbling in cryptocurrency investmentsS'pore exploring restricting retail access to crypto: MAS chief Ravi MenonFTX’s troubles may actually benefit established companies with a track record of risk management, like Nasdaq Stock Market and CBOE Global Markets, wrote Mr Mike Cyprys, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. \rHowever, to Mr Mark Dowding, the chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management, the case for Bitcoin becoming a version of digital gold is bogus. It’s only a matter of time until even more investors bail and crypto prices plunge again, he said. \r“It should have been clear that an industry that has been producing nothing, burning cash and offering alluring returns, was destined to fail,” he said.

The damage will be big.\" The falsified figures were discovered after Nissan found inconsistencies in fuel-economy data.Japan's number-two automaker said it would halt sales of the affected mini-cars, but added that it had no immediate plans to change its business relationship with Mitsubishi, which also makers Lancer cars and the Outlander sport utility vehicle.Mini-cars, or kei-cars, are small vehicles with 660cc gasoline engines that are hugely popular in the Japanese market, although have found little success abroad.Mitsubishi sold more than a million vehicles at home and overseas in its latest fiscal year.The collapse of Mitsubishi's stock on Wednesday was its biggest one-day plunge since 2004.At that time, Mitsubishi was struggling to launch a turnaround as it teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, hit by a lack of cash and a series of huge recalls linked to deadly defects.German titan Volkswagen has been hammered by the global scandal that erupted when it emerged that it had installed emissions-cheating software in 11 million diesel engines worldwide.The costs of the scandal are still incalculable but are expected to run into several billions of dollars as a result of fines and lawsuits.South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia in 2014 agreed to pay US$100 million to settle a US government investigation into exaggerated fuel efficiency on 2012 and 2013 car models sold in the United States.\n\n\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.Automobile sectorFinancial crimesThanks for sharing!"}
